The 16-room Louis XIV-style inn retains its historical roots today, with quilted headboards, gold-leaf French provincial dressers, and elegant chandeliers. It’s nestled in the heart of Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood, which boasts an impressive history of its own—settled in the 1860s, this traditional Scandinavian enclave has a quiet, family-friendly vibe, and hosts Nordic-themed festivals throughout the year.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>In-room amenities</strong>: flat-screen TVs, WiFi, and goose-down comforters; some rooms have private baths</li>\n  <li><strong>Attention foodies</strong>: The hotel is within walking distance of some of the city’s most popular restaurants, including seafood spots, waterfront coffee shops, and a legendary fried-chicken eatery called Hi-Life.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sweet perk</strong>: This getaway includes a bottle of champagne and chocolates to enjoy at your leisure.</li>\n  <li><strong>Peace and quiet</strong>: The hotel only accepts guests 18 and older in order to maintain a tranquil environment.</li>\n  <li><strong>Access to a 50,000-square foot health club</strong> is included with your stay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Seattle&#8217;s Ballard District: Historic Scandinavian Fishing Town with Trendy Waterfront Dining</h4>\n\n<p>Scandinavian immigrants began settling in the Puget Sound area as far back as 1860. Many of them set down roots in the Ballard neighborhood, a quiet spot located on Salmon Bay just northwest of downtown Seattle. Ballard has since turned into a trendy neighborhood with numerous foodie-approved restaurants and a solid live music scene.</p>\n\n<p>But you can still see remnants of its past. The Nordic Heritage Museum showcases the cultures of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in contemporary art exhibits, folk costume galleries, musical performances, and movie screenings. After a visit to the museum, sample kringle, a Danish pretzel pastry filled with almond paste and raisins, at one of the Scandinavian bakeries along Market Street. You can also take a walking tour past art-deco buildings and landscaped parks.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Floor-to-ceiling windows in <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1ceD2Q0\">inn rooms</a> and <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1ceD36z\">villas</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.mayneislandresort.com/food-wine/\">Bennett Bay Bistro</a>, and the indoor pool deck offer plenty of chances to savor the resplendent scenery. Additionally, all rooms and villas have private balconies facing the ocean.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Sustainable seafood</strong> is on the menu at Bennett Bay Bistro.</li>\n  <li><strong>In-room amenities</strong>: Flat-screen LED TVs and complimentary WiFi. </li>\n  <li><strong>Indulge in a couples massage</strong> at Aquaflora Spa, which uses locally crafted organic products from Sea Wench Naturals.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pick up beer and wine</strong> in the onsite liquor store.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Mayne Island, British Columbia: Hiking and Wildlife Watching in the Gulf Islands</h4>\n\n<p>The first thing you notice on the ferry to Mayne Island is the red-and-white lighthouse atop Georgia Point. It has marked the entrance to Active Pass since 1885; stand at its base for far-reaching views of the Strait of Georgia and to spot harbor seals and pods of orcas frolicking in the waters below. A few miles south of here lies Bennett Bay. In addition to having one of the island&#8217;s best beaches, it&#8217;s a scenic spot to hike to Campbell Point for views of Mount Baker. You can get an even better view of the surrounding Gulf Islands from atop Mount Parke, the island&#8217;s highest point. The wooded trek to the 607-foot summit takes about 45 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Mayne Island is also a good jumping-off point for exploring the rest of the Gulf Islands.

This Getaway includes overnight stays at four hotels, along with tours, transportation, and some meals. Airfare is not included. The tour includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Overnight accommodations at four resorts, including Hilton Garden Inn Liberia Airport, Hotel Borinquen, Hacienda Guachipelin, Hotel El Establo, Hotel Villas Playa Samara, or similar</li>\n  <li>Zipline tour</li>\n  <li>Horseback ride</li>\n  <li>Sky Walk tour &amp; Sky Tram tour</li>\n  <li>Visit of Guaitil Pottery Town</li>\n  <li>Bird-watching tour</li>\n  <li>Tubing adventure</li>\n  <li>Canyon and waterfall tour</li>\n  <li>Airport transfers</li>\n  <li>Transportation between locations</li>\n  <li>Bilingual guides</li>\n  <li>Nine meals </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.costaricamonkeytours.com/costa-rica-tour/\">Click here</a> to see the full itinerary and more details.<br /></p>\n\n<p><iframe width=\"423\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/s5fef71GxFU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h4>Day 1: Liberia, Costa Rica</h4>\n\n<p>You’ll arrive at Daniel Oduber Quirós International Airport (LIR), also known as Liberia International Airport, and take a complimentary shuttle to the first hotel, <a href=\"http://gr.pn/MJb8rk\">Hilton Garden Inn Liberia Airport</a>, or a similar hotel. The rest of the day is open for relaxation.</p>\n\n<h4>Day 2: Rincón de la Vieja Volcano Area</h4>\n\n<p>After breakfast, you’ll head northeast to the Rincón de la Vieja Volcano Area and check in at your next hotel. You&#8217;ll enjoy a full day of adventure tours in the jungle, hot springs, and rivers surrounding the volcano.

This remote network of mangrove swamps is a haven for birds, including storks, egrets, and spoonbills. Then you’ll visit Guaitil, a small town where residents have been making pottery using the same techniques for more than 5,000 years.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll spend the night (and the remainder of the trip) at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/Z4780j\">Hotel Villas Playa Samara</a> (or similar), located just steps from a gorgeous white-sand beach.</p>\n\n<h4>Days 5–8: Samara and Departure</h4>\n\n<p>Hotel Villas Playa Samara&#8217;s whitewashed cottages hug a horseshoe-shaped bay renowned for its calm waters, ideal for swimming and snorkeling. You’ll have plenty of time to explore the area, including its discotheque and many restaurants. About a mile offshore lies a deserted wooded island called Isla Chora. You can explore the island on a kayak tour (additional fee). Expect to find crystal-clear water and a pink beach full of hermit crabs and iguanas.</p>\n\n<p><em>For more information, call (800) 774-5228.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

You can catch glimpses of the waterfront—and the North Shore Mountains beyond—all across the city, but it&#8217;s worth it to visit historic Gastown to shop, dine, and stroll along the harbor. Another retail area worth checking out is Robson Street, a three-block stretch of northern downtown lined with boutique clothing stores and cafes.</p>\n\n<p>At the tip of the peninsula lies Stanley Park, whose 900 acres (400 hectares) encompass forests, beaches, and gardens. The Seawall, a 13-mile (22 km) waterfront path, encircles the park and has designated lanes for walkers, joggers, cyclists, and inline skaters. There are numerous smaller parks spread throughout the city, too, making Vancouver feel like an urban oasis.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Bright and early on day 3, the group pays a visit to the Temple of the Golden Buddha to behold a massive Buddha weighing more than 5 tons. The city&#8217;s nearby flower markets overflow with rare orchids, lotuses, and vibrant marigolds—considered lucky charms in Thailand. The day ends with a tour of a silk factory and the Wat Pho temple, home to a reclining Buddha statue. An optional tour ($40/person) includes dinner, a dance show, and a visit to a night market.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no set itinerary on day 4, so you can explore the city on your own or take part in an optional boat ride ($60/person) that passes the distinctive golden spires of the Grand Palace. </p>\n\n<h4>Day 5: River Kwai</h4>\n\n<p>Journey northwest to see the famous bridge over the River Kwai, built during World War II by prisoners of war and featured in David Lean&#8217;s classic film. Head to the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, where vendors floating in canoes sell snacks, meats, and fresh produce. The balance of the evening can be spent relaxing or taking part in an optional half-hour elephant ride and raft trip along the river ($50/person).</p>\n\n<h4>Days 6 and 7: Ayutthaya and Pattaya</h4>\n\n<p>Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Ayutthaya was the capital of Thailand—then known as Siam—for several centuries. On a tour of the city, you&#8217;ll see temples dating back to this era, many with intricately carved stone spires. The Bang Pa-In Palace features a mix of Gothic, Chinese, and Baroque architectural styles as well as a topiary garden filled with shrubs pruned to resemble elephants and rabbits.</p>\n\n<h4>Days 8–11: Beijing and Departure</h4>\n\n<p>The final leg of the trip brings you to China&#8217;s bustling capital city. It&#8217;s rife with culture and history, including Tiananmen Square, where you&#8217;ll find the Monument to the People&#8217;s Heroes, a 120-foot granite obelisk that honors China&#8217;s fallen soldiers. While you&#8217;re in Beijing, you can use some of your free time to see the hundreds of imperial palaces and buildings that make up the Forbidden City ($28/person) or walk along a portion of the Great Wall of China ($49/person).</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

In Belltown, you’ll find top-notch coffee shops such as Street Bean Espresso, a non-profit space serving sustainable, locally roasted coffee and artisan pastries. Mixed in with the neighborhood’s java dispensaries and trendy restaurants are an array of art galleries, including Roq La Rue, which specializes in pop surrealism and underground contemporary art.</p>\n\n<p>About a half-mile south is <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1yUWZo4\">Pike Place Market</a>, one of Seattle&#8217;s most renowned attractions. Locals and out-of-towners alike flock to this semi-open-air marketplace to shop for fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, flowers, and meat. Come early in the morning to see the market’s fishmongers do what they&#8217;re famous for: tossing the day’s catch back and forth.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

That means you&#8217;ll never run out of activities—the Grand Palladium complex features multiple bars and restaurants, as well as its own shopping plaza, <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1leqaO8\">spa</a>, casino, and four pools. But the real draw is the sandy beach, where you can sunbathe with a frosty cocktail.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Come hungry</strong>: The resort features eight themed à la carte <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1QEoFpA\">restaurants</a> ranging from Brazilian and Japanese to Mediterranean and Tex-Mex, as well as five buffet eateries.</li>\n  <li><strong>Have a drink</strong> at any of the 13 bars on the property, including a swim-up bar, beach bars, and sports bars.</li>\n  <li><strong>Take a dip</strong> in one of four swimming pools or use the included kayaking, windsurfing, and catamaran gear.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep children busy</strong> with activities at the onsite kids&#8217; and teens&#8217; clubs.</li>\n  <li><strong>When the sun goes down</strong>: Try your luck at the onsite casino and watch the nightly entertainment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Punta Cana, Dominican Republic: Miles of White-Sand Beaches</h4>\n\n<p>When Christopher Columbus landed on the Dominican Republic more than five centuries ago, he described it as &#8220;a beautiful island paradise.&#8221; Punta Cana, located on the island&#8217;s easternmost tip, lays legitimate claim to that description. The coast stretches for more than 20 miles and is dotted with coconut palms, chaise lounges, and laid-back bars. Glitzy resorts feature prominently along the shoreline, but Playa El Cortecito, a short drive up the coast, harks back to earlier times. Brightly colored, thatched-roof shacks line the beach, and local fishermen bring their boats to shore each afternoon with the day&#8217;s catch.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. From what airport does the deal depart? How much does it cost to fly from a city that isn&#8217;t included in the deal options?</strong><br />Deal options with 3-letter airport codes depart from that specific airport. Deal options with full city names depart from an airport that is assigned at time of redemption with the tour operator. Departures from airports that are not included in the deal options may be available (and may cost more). Call Vacation Express at 1-800-470-3711 for pricing from any airport that isn&#8217;t listed on the Groupon Getaways deal page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Can we extend our trip before or after the promotional dates for the deal?</strong><br />Yes, please call us at 1-800-470-3711 to check availability and pricing. </p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How do I find out if the dates I want to travel are available?</strong><br />To check the availability of specific dates within the option you would like to purchase, please call us at 1-800-470-3711. </p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Do I need to buy a Groupon for my child?</strong><br /> No your child does not need their own Groupon voucher. You can purchase their package directly with Vacation Express when making your reservation. Prices range from $459-$1079 and are subject to change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Can the person I&#8217;m traveling with fly from a different city?</strong><br />As long as you are sharing a hotel room, the two people traveling together may fly from any city. </p>\n\n<p><strong>6. What happens if I buy the Groupon and my travel dates are not available?</strong><br />We will do everything we can to accommodate the dates you wish to travel. In the event that we are unable to do so, the &#8220;Groupon Promise&#8221; allows you to refund your voucher. </p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Is this deal priced per person? What does &#8220;per person, based on double occupancy&#8221; mean?</strong><br />This deal is priced per person based on two people sharing a room. If only one person will be traveling, the person has to buy a voucher and pay a solo fee directly to Vacation Express at the time of booking. If you have further questions, please call us at 1-800-470-3711. </p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Is the price advertised available on every date?</strong><br />Airfare subject to availability.

There are 10 <a href=\"http://gr.pn/GMxgmb\">restaurants</a>, eight <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1yDyTNl\">bars</a>, a <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1yDz1fZ\">casino</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.treasureisland.com/amenities/spa-salon\">spa and salon</a>, and a theater that&#8217;s home to Sin City&#8217;s original <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1ySWEA0\">Cirque du Soleil show</a>, <em>Mystère</em>. A cast of 75 dancers, aerial acrobats, and clowns wows crowds at the critically acclaimed circus spectacle, which brought Vegas stage shows to a whole new level when it first appeared in 1993 (some options of this Getaway include two tickets). From Thursday–Monday, the <a href=\"http://www.treasureisland.com/shows/5/island-heatkahunaville\">Island Heat Show</a> at Kahunaville showcases classic beach songs and dances with a Hawaiian twist. </p>\n\n<p>At Treasure Island&#8217;s casino, you’ll find table games, slot machines, and daily poker tournaments. Apply your winnings toward filet mignon at Phil’s Italian Steak House, or spring for a Vietnamese dinner at Pho—just two options among the hotel’s wealth of restaurants and bars. If you don&#8217;t choose the Cirque du Soleil tickets, you&#8217;ll get a choice of buffet meals for two. The Buffet at TI offers everything from pizza and BBQ for dinner to a champagne brunch on Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n\n<h4>The Las Vegas Strip: 24/7 Entertainment and Fine Dining</h4>\n\n<p>With an almost unlimited variety of casinos, bars and nightclubs, and live entertainment, the general consensus along the Las Vegas Strip seems to be “go big or go home.” And you can go <em>really</em> big here. Make a beeline for the dozens of 24-hour casinos lining the neon-lit Strip to tango with Lady Luck in high-stakes games of roulette, blackjack, and poker; or grab a front-row seat to the city’s over-the-top glitz at nightly magic, acrobatic, and musical performances. Be sure to stick around for mealtimes—casinos on the Strip are known for their fine-dining restaurants and extravagant buffets overflowing with crab legs and prime rib. </p>\n\n<p>Even Sin City isn’t all casinos, all the time. Go shopping at the high-end boutiques found inside most hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, or head to Fashion Show Las Vegas to browse racks at Neiman Marcus, Macy’s, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

Campbell opened his eponymous waterfront hotel as a way station for cattlemen and other travelers waiting to cross Lake Chelan via steamboat. Though it has grown quite a bit since these humble beginnings, Campbell&#8217;s Resort on Lake Chelan continues its tradition of providing comfort and hospitality to weary travelers—a commitment reinforced most recently by the completion of a $3 million renovation.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Where you&#8217;ll stay</strong>: A traditional or deluxe guest room with free WiFi, a small fridge, a coffee maker, a microwave, and a balcony or porch overlooking Lake Chelan. Deluxe rooms are about 100 square feet larger than traditional rooms and have an efficiency kitchenette.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fill up on granola waffles</strong> for breakfast or ahi tacos for dinner at the onsite restaurant, Campbell&#8217;s Pub &amp; Veranda, where dishes are crafted from organic Pacific Northwest ingredients. </li>\n  <li><strong>Winter drinks</strong>: Sip on one of the weekly seasonal cocktails—such as the Cozy Flannel with cognac and all-spice dram—while sitting next to the fireplace.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pamper yourself</strong> at the River Room Spa, which offers massages and manicures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Chelan, Washington: Lakefront Community in the Foothills of the Cascade Range</h4>\n\n<p>Chelan lies in the shadow of the Cascade Range in northern Washington, right on the banks of Lake Chelan. The 55-mile-long, glacier-fed lake is a popular spot for boating and jet skiing in the summertime. It’s also a fisherman’s paradise—Lake Chelan has a renowned fish-stocking program that releases hundreds of thousands of chinook salmon, lake trout, and kokanee into the chilly waters each year.</p>\n\n<p>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, located a few miles west of Chelan, provides ample opportunities to explore the great outdoors on hundreds of miles of hiking and mountain-biking trails. In the winter, cross-country skiers flock to nearby Echo Ridge for 25 miles of trails, and snowmobilers and downhill skiers take to the powder at Echo Valley.</p>\n\n<p>Chelan&#8217;s small downtown area encompasses local boutiques, gift shops, bookstores, and homey pubs that serve wines from emerging local wineries. For a closer look at the vineyards, visit some of the area’s nearly two dozen wineries for tastings and tours.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Walker and Percy A. Eisen, the same duo who designed LA&#8217;s Beverly Wilshire hotel and Fine Arts Building. A multimillion-dollar renovation has returned the hotel to its Jazz Age splendor; construction crews pried open decades-old skylights to allow natural light back in, and the original terrazzo has been restored in the lobby.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>1920s glamour</strong> characterizes the lobby, from the original flooring to the art-deco-inspired stone fireplace, velvet couches, and lavish chandelier.</li>\n  <li><strong>In-room amenities</strong>: flat-screen TV and free WiFi</li>\n  <li><strong>Notable guest</strong>: British author Malcolm Lowry wrote <em>Under the Volcano</em> while staying at the hotel in the 1930s.</li>\n  <li><strong>Nearby attraction</strong>: The hotel is 3 miles from LA&#8217;s Museum Row, where you can find the massive and critically acclaimed Los Angeles County Museum of Art, home to more than 100,000 works.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat at Cassell&#8217;s</strong>: More than a hamburger stand, the hotel&#8217;s onsite restaurant features a classic &#8217;50s breakfast menu, coffee bar, housemade sodas, and a fully stocked bar.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Wilshire District, Los Angeles: Shopping, Restaurants, and Museum Row</h4>\n\n<p>Wilshire Boulevard runs for 15 miles through Los Angeles, ending at Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. There are dozens of restaurants and boutiques along the boulevard. Museum Row is also located on the Boulevard, in the so-called Miracle Mile between Fairfax Boulevard and La Brea Boulevard. Four of Los Angeles&#8217; most notable institutions are clustered here: <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/los-angeles/los-angeles-county-george-c-page-museum\">The Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/los-angeles/los-angeles-county-museum-of-art\">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/los-angeles/craft-folk-art-museum\">Craft and Folk Art Museum</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/los-angeles/petersen-automotive-museum\">Petersen Automotive Museum</a>. Preserved Ice Age fossils of mammoths, dire wolves, and saber-toothed tigers are on display at the Page, all of which were excavated by paleontologists at the neighboring La Brea Tar Pits. </p>\n\n<p>The bright lights of Hollywood aren&#8217;t too far away. The cemented handprints of Tinseltown celebs, including Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne, are on the sidewalk in front of the iconic <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/los-angeles/tcl-chinese-theatre\">TCL Chinese Theatre</a> (formerly known as Grauman&#8217;s Chinese Theatre). You can experience the movies firsthand at Universal Studios Hollywood. Its interactive thrill rides are inspired by classic and contemporary films such as <em>King Kong</em>, <em>Jurassic Park</em>, and <em>Transformers</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Day 3 kicks off with a half-day tour of the most famous landmarks, including the trendy Ginza shopping district and the palace of the imperial family. This leg of the trip comes to a close with a visit to Mount Fuji on Day 4.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Senso-ji</strong>: One of Tokyo&#8217;s oldest temples features a five-story pagoda set amid stalls where you can buy traditional Japanese dishes and handcrafted souvenirs.</li>\n  <li><strong>See views from 7,500 feet</strong> on an aerial tram that takes passengers up Mount Fuji.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cruise on Lake Ashi</strong> to snap scenic pics of Mount Fuji as reflected on the surface of the water.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Days 5–7: Mount Fuji Area and Kyoto</h4>\n\n<p>Next, the tour moves to Japan&#8217;s erstwhile capital city, Kyoto. It can feel as though every street corner in town has an elaborate temple, shrine, or garden—the city is rumored to have more than 1,000 Buddhist temples alone. Elsewhere, local marketplaces and restaurants continue the traditions of old Japan. After checking out some of the sacred sites, you&#8217;ll have free time before boarding a flight for Beijing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Nijo Castle</strong>: A network of moats and ancient stone walls protects the pagoda-style buildings of this UNESCO World Heritage Site where several shoguns once lived.</li>\n  <li><strong>Golden Pavilion</strong>: The dazzling exterior is covered in gold leaf that reflects off a placid pond below. Tour the grounds to see sprawling gardens and intimate teahouses. If you spot a statue in the gardens, toss a coin in its direction for good luck.</li>\n  <li><strong>Kiyomizu Temple</strong>: No nails were used during the rebuilding of this eighth-century structure in the 1600s—and that&#8217;s just the start of the property&#8217;s magical qualities. There&#8217;s also a waterfall that visitors drink from to gain long life and prosperity. Drinking straws are not included.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional Nara and Osaka tour</strong>: Visit Nara&#8217;s Great Eastern Temple and the monumental Osaka Castle during this daylong excursion (Day 6; $80/person). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Days 8–10: Beijing</h4>\n\n<p>Beijing&#8217;s rich history is ever present. While strolling the streets, you&#8217;ll see ornate temples, ancient alleyways lined with shops and teahouses, and open-air markets that have been around for centuries. At the city center stands the Forbidden City, which served as a royal residence to 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties. And of course, there&#8217;s the Great Wall of China, which winds its way across the landscape north of Beijing. Before your tour comes to a close, you&#8217;ll see Qianmen Street and sites from the 2008 Olympics.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Tiananmen Square</strong>: Take a moment at this highly politicized landmark to visit the Monument to the People&#8217;s Heroes, a 120-foot obelisk commemorating fallen Chinese soldiers.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional Forbidden City and Palace Museum tour</strong>: The former home of the Qing and Ming dynasties includes an incredible 800 buildings with thousands of rooms decked out in priceless artwork, antique furnishings, and precious jade (Day 8; $28/person).</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional Great Wall and Sacred Way tour</strong>: Don&#8217;t pass up a chance to step foot on China&#8217;s 4,000-mile landmark, parts of which date back more than 2,000 years (Day 9; $49/person).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

Once the stomping grounds of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and the Rat Pack, the town still attracts A-list vacationers today. A stroll through the Movie Colony—which had its heyday between the 1930s and 1960s—will take you past the former homes of Dean Martin, Bob Hope, and Marilyn Monroe.</p>\n\n<p>Palm Springs is also the birthplace of desert modernism, a Bauhaus-influenced architecture movement. You can explore the area&#8217;s famed midcentury-modern landmarks on a self-guided tour; grab a map at the Palm Springs Official Visitors Center, itself housed in an iconic building—a retro-futuristic Tramway Gas Station designed by Albert Frey. Furniture and clothing boutiques along Palm Canyon Drive embrace Palm Springs&#8217; trademark aesthetic—what you might call <em>Mad Men</em> West. Nearby, the small but impressively curated Palm Springs Art Museum features works by Pablo Picasso and Robert Rauschenberg along with significant contemporary and Native American collections.</p>\n\n<p>The sun shines more than 300 days a year in Palm Springs, which means you can play a round of golf or hike in the nearby Agua Caliente Indian Canyons no matter the season. It’s worth taking a ride on the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, whose cars rotate 360 degrees as they carry passengers to Mount San Jacinto’s Mountain Station, located 8,516 feet above sea level. About 40 miles northeast is the nearly 800,000-acre Joshua Tree National Park, which spans parts of the Colorado and Mojave Deserts. Hit one of the 12 nature trails for a chance to see desert bighorn sheep, snakes, and black-tailed jackrabbits.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

After hiking and biking your way through, you can find even more natural wonders in Silverton&#8217;s Oregon Garden. Full of blooming flowers and pleasant pathways, it&#8217;s also home to the Gordon House, one of Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s Usonian wonders. Downtown is filled with plenty of shops and eateries, many of which overlook the creek.</p>\n\n<p>Just 15 miles away from Silverton lies Salem. Oregon’s capital city is nestled in the picturesque Willamette Valley, where lush hillsides are dotted with small towns, sustainable farms, and hundreds of vineyards producing the region’s world-famous pinot noir. The pastoral landscape surrounding Salem hides the fact that the city is one of Oregon’s biggest—second only to Portland. The city takes advantage of its spot on the Willamette River with a 23-acre waterfront park where you can kayak or ride bikes or the Riverfront Carousel. Downtown Salem is home to the Oregon State Capitol and Willamette University, one of the oldest universities in the western United States.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

It&#8217;s located within easy reach of Pike Place Market and other downtown Seattle landmarks. Before you turn in for the day, be sure to grab a complimentary Washington apple from the lobby.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Included perk</strong>: daily valet parking</li>\n  <li><strong>The Lodge Sports Grille</strong> serves up locally sourced burgers and seafood along with more than 50 types of beer amid hand-hewn cedar walls and TVs showing sports.</li>\n  <li><strong>Housemade gelato</strong> and bistro-style sandwiches are on the menu at the Vovito café.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stylish guest rooms</strong> are trimmed in rich cherry-wood accents and feature flat-screen LCD TVs and free WiFi.</li>\n  <li><strong>Complimentary wine reception</strong> held in the lobby each evening</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Downtown Seattle: Art, Architecture, and Famous Coffee in Coastal Urban Center</h4>\n\n<p>Street performances, flowers, and fresh-caught fish find a common home at Seattle’s <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1yUWZo4\">Pike Place Market</a>. Founded in 1907, this market is where both sightseers and locals shop for fresh seafood, meat, and produce. Drop into the Fish Market to watch the staff tossing salmon, halibut, cod—a famous tradition. There are plenty of nonperishable goods as well, including jewelry and other crafts. And you might want to take a picture in front of the market’s iconic sign, which now rivals Space Needle as the city’s most-recognizable symbol.</p>\n\n<p>The original Starbucks coffeehouse has operated out of Pike Place since the 1970s. You can stop here for a pick-me-up before taking the half-mile walk to Seattle Central Library. Whether you love books or architecture or both, this futuristic-looking library is worth a visit. The 11-story glass-and-steel structure consists almost entirely of diamond-shaped windows arranged to look like a geometric net. The otherworldly interior is a playground for book lovers. Be sure to check out the library’s “living room” in the morning, when sunlight creates a kaleidoscopic shadow on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Like the library, the nearby <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/seattle/seattle-art-museum\">Seattle Art Museum</a> is full of spectacles, starting with its collection of “exploding” white Ford Tauruses suspended from the lobby ceiling. Exhibits range from Renaissance-era European art to Korean and Japanese panels.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

You&#8217;ll stay in an all-inclusive, adults-only beachfront resort. This vacation includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Round-trip airfare from Raleigh/Durham (RDU), New York City, Chicago (ORD), Toronto (YYZ), Buffalo (BUF), Denver (DEN), or Boston (BOS)</li>\n  <li>4 nights of all-inclusive standard room accommodations at BlueBay Villas Doradas</li>\n  <li>All meals and snacks</li>\n  <li>Unlimited domestic drinks and alcoholic beverages</li>\n  <li>Daily activities </li>\n  <li>Nightly entertainment</li>\n  <li>Nonmotorized watersports</li>\n  <li>Hotel tax, service charges, and gratuities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Resort at a Glance: BlueBay Villas Doradas</h4>\n\n<p>The toughest question at this all-inclusive resort is &#8220;What to do first?&#8221; You could enjoy the unlimited international eats, go kayaking on the Caribbean, listen to live music, or much more. You&#8217;ll have plenty of time to squeeze everything in. The villas are reserved strictly for adults and cater to couples with a private beachfront that&#8217;s ideal for watching the sunset.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Picturesque setting</strong>: The resort enjoys a seafront location along the Playa Dorada, making it easy to go relax along the Caribbean coast.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Explore the ocean</strong>: Windsurfing, snorkeling, and sailing are available onsite at no extra charge. The all-inclusive plan also comes with an intro to diving lesson.</li>\n  <li><strong>Diverse dining</strong>: Savor fresh seafood and sample fusion cuisine at four restaurants as part of the all-inclusive perks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Take a dip</strong> in one of the resort&#8217;s three swimming pools, one of which has a swim-up bar.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tee off</strong> on Playa Dorada Golf Course, which is right next door.</li>\n  <li><strong>Dance the night away</strong>: The resort offers lessons in bachata and merengue (extra charge).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic: Waterfalls, Beaches, and Centuries-Old Historical Sites</h4>\n\n<p>Situated on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Plata is best known for its sun-kissed beaches. But the province has several breathtaking geographical features inland as well. Damajagua is a natural water park of sorts—it features 27 waterfalls flowing from limestone rock formations. Tour guides lead groups through the falls, and you can swim and occasionally slide down the natural water slides.</p>\n\n<p>You can get an aerial view of Puerto Plata and the Caribbean Sea on a teleférico, or cable car. One of them climbs 2,565 feet to the apex of Mount Isabel de Torres, which is crowned with blooming botanical gardens and a replica of Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s massive <em>Christ the Redeemer</em> statue. It&#8217;s also worth it to take a scenic drive to Parque Histórico La Isabela, where you&#8217;ll find the remains of a church as well as ruins of a colonial village where Columbus routinely woke his neighbors by blasting the <i>Santa Maria</i>&#8217;s foghorn.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. From what airport does the deal depart?  How much does it cost to fly from a city that isn&#8217;t included in the deal options?</strong> Deal options with 3-letter airport codes depart from that specific airport. Deal options with full city names depart from an airport that is assigned at time of redemption with the tour operator. Departures from airports that are not included in the deal options may be available (and may cost more). Call Travel by Jen at 1-800-603-3178 for pricing from any airport that isn&#8217;t listed on the Groupon Getaways deal page.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How do I find out if the dates I want to travel are available?</strong> To check the availability of specific dates within the option you would like to purchase, please call us at 1-800-603-3178.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Do I need to buy a Groupon for my child?</strong> BlueBay Villas Doradas is an adults-only property. Guests under 18 years old are not permitted.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Can the person I&#8217;m traveling with fly from a different city?</strong> As long as you are sharing a hotel room, the two people traveling together may fly from any city.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. What happens if I buy the Groupon and my travel dates are not available?</strong> We will do everything we can to accommodate the dates you wish to travel. In the event that we are unable to do so, the &#8220;Groupon Promise&#8221; allows you to refund your voucher.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Is this deal priced per person? What does &#8220;per person, based on double occupancy&#8221; mean?</strong> Prices are per person based on a minimum of 2 passengers booking together and sharing a hotel room. Each traveler must purchase a Groupon Voucher. Solo travelers must pay a single room supplement fee directly to Travel by Jen, as no room matching program is available. If you have further questions, please call us at 1-800-603-3178.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>7.  Is the price advertised available on every date?</strong> Airfare subject to availability.

Set on the shores of Lake Ontario, the city’s scenic hiking and walking trails wind along the harbor front. From there, a northerly stroll takes you to the Fashion District, where warehouses and old factories that sat empty for years now house upscale restaurants, galleries, and cutting-edge boutiques. A bit farther north lies Kensington Market, a bohemian village rife with vintage shops and organic-food markets.</p>\n\n<p>Toronto may be home to Canada’s best collection of museums. Hockey is a national pastime, so it makes sense that the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/toronto/hockey-hall-of-fame\">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> is here. Its interactive Pepsi Shut Out exhibit challenges goaltender wannabes to stop a slap shot against a virtual Wayne Gretzky. The Hall of Fame’s centerpiece is the hallowed Esso Great Hall, home to the Stanley Cup and portraits of all 375 inductees. Science buffs can stop at the Ontario Science Centre, where you can watch an IMAX film, delve into space at the planetarium, or touch a plasma ball at the Science Arcade.</p>\n\n<p>The nearby <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/toronto/art-gallery-of-ontario-1\">Art Gallery of Ontario</a> exhibits an astounding collection of work from Canadian artists and European masters in a Frank Gehry–designed building that centers on a circular floating staircase. Toronto is also known as a city of gardens, and you’ll find one of its best, the Toronto Music Garden, stretched out along the waterfront. Designed in part by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the Music Garden translates the music of Bach through beautiful landscaped installations, including a winding river and giant grass steps.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

In the early 20th century, its owners transformed the orchard&#8217;s modest cabins into a full-fledged resort, attracting visitors with home-cooked meals at the onsite restaurant and unparalleled views of Deer Harbor and the Olympic Mountains. You can still find the same down-home hospitality and tranquil scenery here.</p>\n\n<p>The inn&#8217;s cottages are scattered across 5 wooded acres where you might spot rabbits, deer, and bald eagles. You’ll find private, four-person hot tubs on the back decks of the two homey <a href=\"http://gr.pn/SuzETG\">Orchard cottages</a>, which are surrounded by apple trees in a nod to the property’s history as an orchard. Inside, quilted bedcovers top comfy handmade beds. The two-bedroom <a href=\"http://www.deerharborinn.com/the-pond-cottage.htm\">Pond cottage</a> also has a hot tub, as well as a full kitchen. <a href=\"http://www.deerharborinn.com/log-cabin-lodge.htm\">Log cabin lodge rooms</a>, meanwhile, are housed in a building with a fireplace indoors and a six-person hot tub out back.</p>\n\n<p>Each morning, wake up with a complimentary goodie basket. <a href=\"http://gr.pn/SuAnnP\">The Deer Harbor Inn Restaurant</a> has been around for nearly a century and serves entrees made with fresh seafood and seasonal produce. The inn also has a spa, located inside a private cottage, where you can receive an organic facial or a couples massage.</p>\n\n<h4>Orcas Island, Washington: Whale Watching and Hiking near Artsy Hamlets</h4>\n\n<p>Nicknamed the &#8220;emerald isle&#8221; for its rolling hills covered in douglas firs, Orcas Island is the largest of Washington’s San Juan Islands. Its bays are filled with sea anemones, eel, and sunflower starfish—massive starfish that can have more than 20 arms. Between March and October, you can take whale-watching tours to see native birds, seals, and orca whales.</p>\n\n<p>Take a scenic drive to the island&#8217;s artsy Eastsound Village. There’s no official mayor of this hamlet, though cows, sheep, and dogs have all held honorary office here in the past. The village is home to a number of art galleries and casual eateries, as well as a Saturday farmers’ market with live music in the summer.</p>\n\n<p>At Moran State Park, on the east side of the island, you can hike, bike, or ride horseback along 30 miles of wooded trails. If you’re feeling ambitious, you can climb the 2,400-foot Mount Constitution. The highest point in the San Juan Islands, it rewards climbers with postcard-worthy views of the surrounding islands and, on really clear days, Mount Rainier.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

But it&#8217;s actually a roadside inn in Leavenworth, a Bavarian-themed hamlet nestled in the Cascade Mountains. Set along the town&#8217;s main drag, Front Street, the inn is only a five-minute walk from galleries, boutique gift shops, and cafés serving locally brewed beer. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Start off the morning</strong> with a free continental breakfast.</li>\n  <li><strong>Winter fun</strong>: Go skiing, snow tubing, or ice skating at Leavenworth Ski Hill, less than 2 miles from the inn, or visit the <a href=\"http://www.leavenworth.org/event/4600\">Christmas Lighting Festival</a>, every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, 12/4–12/20/15.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ski in the Cascades</strong> at Stevens Pass, about a 40-minute drive away.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bring along Fido</strong>: Limited pet-friendly rooms are available for an additional fee.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Leavenworth, Washington: Bavarian-Themed Town near Skiing and Whitewater Rafting</h4>\n\n<p>Located about a two-hour drive east of Seattle, Leavenworth draws visitors all year long with an abundance of outdoor activities. In the winter, skiers and snowboarders hit the slopes at nearby Stevens Pass; hikers and whitewater rafters take over in the spring, summer, and fall. About 700 miles of trails surround the town, meandering through the Cascade Range and the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. The Icicle and Wenatchee Rivers run through the area as well, attracting rafters with Class II and III rapids.</p>\n\n<p>Leavenworth is a center for all things Bavarian. You’ll find German-style bakeries, bars with beer gardens, and several restaurants where you can try kielbasa, bratwurst, ciderkraut, and specialty mustards. The town’s annual Oktoberfest takes place over the course of three weekends, beginning with a procession of villagers sporting traditional dirndls and lederhosen.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

There&#8217;s also a pair of outdoor <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1OAlZGz\">swimming pools</a>, a hot tub, and a sun deck furnished with cushy loungers. For no extra charge, guests can use the resort&#8217;s kayaks, snorkeling gear, and boogie boards.

With the sea on one side and freshwater lagoons on the other, it&#8217;s a popular spot for sailing and snorkeling. Although the beaches and barrier reefs are a major draw, the geography is equally enticing further inland, where you can dive into an underground river or take a speedboat through a mangrove jungle.</p>\n\n<p>Cancún pulls in millions of visitors each year, so escaping the crowds and the party atmosphere isn&#8217;t always easy, but a visit to Playa Delfines offers a chance for sunbathing in relative seclusion. Resorts have yet to encroach upon this stretch of sand, and it&#8217;s especially popular with surfers.</p>\n\n<p>The stone columns of El Rey Ruins, an ancient Mayan site dating back to the second and third centuries BCE, lie within the city’s Hotel Zone. Believed to be a royal burial ground, the archaeological site is also home to wild iguanas that lounge in the sun. For a Mayan-themed day trip, take a 1.5-hour drive from Cancún down the coast to <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1zrvvBM\">Tulum</a>, a pre-Columbian walled city located on a bluff overlooking the sea—one of the Yucatán Peninsula&#8217;s most visited Mayan ruins. The Mayan city of Chichén Itzá, chosen as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007, is only a 2.5-hour drive from Cancún.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>1.

Departures from airports that are not included in the deal options may be available (and may cost more).

After one night in Athens, you&#8217;ll take a ferry to the picturesque island of Mykonos, where you&#8217;ll spend three nights before enjoying another three nights on the storied isle of Santorini. You&#8217;ll spend one more night in Athens before returning to the United States. This vacation <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1MS0oGD\">includes</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Round-trip airfare from New York (specific gateway determined by availability)</li>\n  <li>2 nights in a standard room at the <a href=\"http://www.polisgrandhotel.gr/\">Polis Grand</a> or similar in Athens</li>\n  <li>Regular ferry from Athens to Mykonos in economy class</li>\n  <li>3 nights of standard accommodations at the <a href=\"http://www.vanillahotel.gr/\">Hotel Vanilla</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mykonosbeach.gr/\">Mykonos Beach</a>, or similar in Mykonos</li>\n  <li>Hydrofoil from Mykonos to Santorini in economy class</li>\n  <li>3 nights in a standard room at the <a href=\"http://www.hotelsunrise-santorini.com/\">Hotel Sunrise</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nikolashotel.gr/\">Nikolas Hotel</a>, or similar in Santorini</li>\n  <li>Regular ferry from Santorini to Athens in economy class</li>\n  <li>Daily breakfast</li>\n  <li>All taxes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Athens</h4>\n\n<p>Kick off your vacation in Athens, the longstanding capital of Greece and an epicenter for culture and ancient history. During your 2 nights in this vibrant city, you can browse art museums and historical sites, pick up souvenirs, and immerse yourself in the local culture at an open-air bazaar.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Parthenon</strong>: Perched high above the Acropolis since around 450 BC, this temple to the goddess Athena features striking Doric columns and intricate marble friezes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Acropolis Museum</strong>: The angular, modernistic building presents a contemporary counterpart to the aged Acropolis. The museum&#8217;s thousands of artifacts include a marble statue of Athena and a terra-cotta sculpture of Nike.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat like a local</strong> at the Central Market, where you can nibble artisan cheeses and sample patsas, a popular soup made with lamb.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Mykonos</h4>\n\n<p>For all its beauty—including whitewashed villages, beachfront windmills, and cobblestone streets—Mykonos has been best known for its legendary party scene ever since it became a jet-setting location for the rich and famous in the 1970s. You’ll have a chance to enjoy both sides of the island while you’re here.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Aegean Maritime Museum</strong> celebrates the island&#8217;s close relationship with the sea, displaying model ships, engraved nautical maps, and other artifacts.</li>\n  <li><strong>Panagia Paraportiani</strong>: This Byzantine church&#8217;s cluster of whitewashed stone façades stands out amid the island&#8217;s hundreds of religious sites.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Santorini</h4>\n\n<p>Santorini was named the world&#8217;s fourth-best island by <em>Travel + Leisure</em> readers in 2013, partly for its dramatic landscape of red cliffs and black-sand beaches. The island owes much of its appearance to a volcanic eruption that took place more than 3,500 years ago.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Red Beach</strong>: Black volcanic pebbles are scattered on the ruddy sands of this popular beach, which extends to towering red cliffs.</li>\n  <li><strong>Go scuba diving</strong> to explore Santorini&#8217;s underwater caldera close up.</li>\n  <li><strong>See ancient sculptures</strong> from the Hellenistic and Roman eras at the Archaeological Museum.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Know Before You Go</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Official language</strong>: Greek</li>\n  <li><strong>Currency</strong>: Euro</li>\n  <li><strong>Drive on the</strong> right side of the road.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

Its main appeal hasn&#8217;t changed much since then: Follow in the footsteps of its early guests by fly-fishing for rainbow trout and hiking in the surrounding forest. The main lodge and some of the cabins are original to the property, though they&#8217;ve since been updated. All cabins feature full kitchens and bathrooms, and many have large decks and gas or wood-burning fireplaces. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Ping-pong and foosball tables</strong> in the recreation room, along with a pool table and board games.</li>\n  <li><strong>Warm up by the fire</strong> in the great room and peruse the lodge&#8217;s historical photo album.</li>\n  <li><strong>Grab a cup o&#8217; joe</strong> in the Espresso Cafe. Open 7 days a week and serves pastries. Soups are available daily in the dining room.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Bridges Restaurant</strong> Open Wednesday – Sunday serving breakfast, lunch and dinner (dinner is served family style by reservation). Pair your meal with the lodge&#8217;s wines; $30 dining credit included.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pet-friendly amenities</strong>: a blanket, towel, dish, and doggie bags</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Camp Sherman, Oregon: Fly-Fishing and Hiking in Central Oregon</h4>\n\n<p>The Metolius River burbles through the center of Camp Sherman, a rural community tucked away in the Deschutes National Forest. Its chilly waters are home to some of the best fly-fishing in the state—toss a line in and you might hook rainbow trout, whitefish, or kokanee salmon. You&#8217;ll find these same fish on display, along with countless others, at the Wizard Falls Fish Hatchery a few miles up the road.</p>\n\n<p>Venture deep into the Deschutes National Forest for even more outdoor recreation. Hundreds of miles of hiking and biking trails wend through coniferous and sub-alpine forests. Trek a portion of the 100-mile-long Metolius-Windigo Trail—the trail picks up in the nearby town of Sisters—and look out for the mule deer, coyotes, and migratory birds that call the national forest home. </p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

In addition, there&#8217;s an onsite casino open seven days a week and featuring 18 table games and more than 1,600 slot and video poker machines. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Free live music</strong> is offered Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. at Coco Lounge; while you&#8217;re there, try the signature CocoTini.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat your way around the world</strong> at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1e8oH78\">Festival Buffet</a>, where six all-you-can-eat cooking stations feature Italian, Mongolian, and other international specialties.</li>\n  <li><strong>Good for kids</strong>: There&#8217;s a large outdoor pool and arcade room onsite.</li>\n  <li><strong>Nearby Attractions</strong>: The awe-inspiring Hoover Dam is just 21 miles away. The resort is also just 12 miles from Lake Mead, and includes complimentary oversized parking for boats and recreational vehicles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Henderson, Nevada: Thriving Suburb Close to the Vegas Strip</h4>\n\n<p>A Las Vegas suburb, Henderson is conveniently close to the Strip but also far enough away to be an escape from the bustle. Livability.com named it a top family vacation destination, highlighting the city’s culture scene, which includes area art galleries and outdoor symphony concerts. At the Clark County Museum, visitors can trace southern Nevada’s history via a timeline exhibit. The museum campus also has several historic buildings—including a decades-old barn and a wedding chapel—as well as a walk-in mining trail.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll find the Hoover Dam, one of America’s Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders, about 20 miles east of town. Take the guided tour if you want to learn more about the dam’s history and get a look at the inner passageways. Nearby Lake Mead hosts all sorts of watersports, including kayaking and fishing, but the bulk of the lake’s recreation area consists of mountains and valley with trails for hiking.</p>\n\n<p>Henderson’s shopping scene is another draw: the town features one of the most popular malls off the Strip, Galleria at Sunset. The two-level shopping center houses more than 140 shops and five department stores. But Galleria really stands out because of its Southwestern-themed decor, including fountains, palm trees, and a topiary of animals in the food court. Alternatively, The District at Green Valley Ranch offers an outdoor shopping experience with a pedestrian-friendly promenade that’s lined with boutiques and restaurants. There are also ample opportunities to relax here with a lushly landscaped central park and a grassy courtyard where musicians play live on Friday and Saturday nights from May through October.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

This secluded inn is tucked into the Sierra Nevada mountains along the park&#8217;s western border. Guest-room balconies overlook untouched wilderness centered on the rushing river and the towering pines lining it on both sides.</p>\n\n<p>One of these private balconies or terraces is attached to each double-queen <a href=\"http://gr.pn/utXAPE\">river-view room</a>. After admiring the swift-moving waterway, step back inside to warm up by the fireplace or brew a pot of coffee in the kitchenette. Each guest room is also outfitted with a spa tub, where you can make use of the products included with the spa gift basket.</p>\n\n<p>Six outdoor hot tubs burble on the river&#8217;s edge, enabling splash wars with passing trout. Use your $10 dining credit to fuel up for outdoor adventures at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/u3P4fL\">River Restaurant &amp; Lounge</a>, which serves traditional American breakfast and dinner year-round. The lodge&#8217;s convenience store sells groceries for lodgers looking to prepare their own meals and snacks.</p>\n\n<h4>El Portal, California: Gateway to Winter Adventure in Yosemite National Park</h4>\n\n<p>California State Route 140 follows the snaking Merced River 20 miles into Yosemite National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that welcomes millions of visitors every year. Thanks to low elevations, much of the Yosemite Valley, as well as the Wawona area farther south, remains accessible to drivers, hikers, and snowball poachers throughout the winter.</p>\n\n<p>Crowds are much smaller in the cooler months than during the summer rush, allowing for leisurely exploration of the park as well as an introduction to its cold-weather phenomena. In autumn, the leaves of big-leaf maples, black oaks, and pacific dogwoods turn brilliant shades of yellow and orange, providing a sharp contrast with the park’s many evergreens. During a short span in late February, the Horsetail Fall cascade often glows orange at sunset, flowing down El Capitan like a plume of flaming lava.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The view is especially brilliant at sunset, when the surrounding waters reflect the sky&#8217;s warm pink and orange tones. The hotel&#8217;s location is enviable not only for its beach access, but also for a nearby shuttle stop that can whisk guests to downtown Cannon Beach.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Indoor saltwater pool</strong> filtered with natural salt</li>\n  <li><strong>Roast  s&#8217;mores</strong> right on the beach.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Get pampered</strong>: Select massages and other services are available via Cannon Beach Spa.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Cannon Beach, Oregon: Quaint Coastal Hamlet with Artistic Vibe</h4>\n\n<p>The most notable feature of the skyline in Cannon Beach is an enormous rock. That would be Haystack Rock, a 235-foot monolith rising from the sea along the Oregon coast. Tucked between forested hills and the Pacific Ocean, Cannon Beach is a beauty, with dramatic sunsets, wide-open expanses of sand, and gentle waves. Head to nearby Ecola State Park for the full view, complete with migrating gray whales in the distance. You can also take to hiking trails once traversed by members of the Lewis and Clark expedition.</p>\n\n<p>In town, there’s a palpable artistic vibe. Public art installations are scattered throughout, and the streets are lined with local galleries, cedar-shingled boutiques, and wine bars. You can watch a glassblower craft colorful baubles, snag tickets to a live show, or browse the booths at one of the annual art festivals.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The trip begins in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal and one of the oldest cities in Europe (it predates London, Paris, and Rome by several centuries). After 3 nights in Lisbon, you&#8217;ll fly to São Miguel Island, about 1,000 miles off the coast. São Miguel is the largest island of the Azores, a lush archipelago that&#8217;s largely unspoiled thanks to its remoteness. This vacation includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Round-trip airfare from Boston (BOS)</li>\n  <li>3 nights of accommodations at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1OWwXJf\">Hotel Açores Lisboa</a> in Lisbon</li>\n  <li>3 nights of accommodations at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/17Q0qBh\">São Miguel Park Hotel</a> on São Miguel Island</li>\n  <li>Flight from Lisbon to Azores islands</li>\n  <li>Daily breakfast</li>\n  <li>Each passenger is allowed to transport 1 checked baggage with 23 kg (50 lbs) and 1 volume carry-on baggage up to 8 kg (17 lbs) not exceeding 55cm x 40cm x 20cm.</li>\n  <li>Click <a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-sata-lisbon-azores/special_content\">here</a> for flight information</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Lisbon</h4>\n\n<p>Your home base in the Portuguese capital is the Hotel Açores Lisboa. Located about a 20-minute walk northwest of downtown, this four-star hotel offers modern accommodations close to the heart of the city. The hotel is within walking distance of the Praça de Espanha metro and bus stations. Chic guest rooms are equipped with cable TV and WiFi. There’s an onsite restaurant and bar serving regional dishes. Below are some of our suggestions for how to spend your time in Lisbon.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Parque das Nações</strong>: This waterfront park contains a promenade, a multilevel shopping mall, and one of the world&#8217;s largest aquariums.</li>\n  <li><strong>Torre de Belém</strong> is a 16th-century stone tower at the entrance to Lisbon’s harbor. Climb to the top for sweeping views.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hidden gem</strong>: The Dr. Anastácio Gonçalves museum is considered one of the most beautiful Art Nouveau buildings in the country. Inside you’ll find 19th-century Portuguese paintings, Chinese porcelain, and Dutch furniture.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tram Line 28</strong>: This antique yellow tramcar winds through the Arab Quarter, the downtown district of Baixa, and the nightlife hubs of Chiado and Bairro Alto.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>São Miguel Island</h4>\n\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll fly from Lisbon to São Miguel Island, where you&#8217;ll spend 3 nights at the tucked-away São Miguel Park Hotel. When you&#8217;re not exploring the island, you can relax in the hot tub or kick back by an outdoor pool or sunlit indoor pool surrounded by walls of windows. The onsite restaurant specializes in regional cuisine based on local fruits, vegetables, and fresh grilled seafood. Here are a few things to check out while you&#8217;re here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Hot springs</strong>: São Miguel is a volcanic island, so you&#8217;ll have no trouble finding natural pools heated by geothermal activity.</li>\n  <li><strong>São Sebastião Catholic Church</strong>: a 16th-century masterpiece with accents of rare brazilian wood and actual gold thread on the inside</li>\n  <li><strong>The Gorreana Tea Estate</strong>: Operated since 1883, this is arguably the oldest tea plantation in all of Europe. You can take a tour or sample fresh green tea in the tearoom.</li>\n  <li><strong>António Borges Botanical Gardens</strong> is a good spot to see rare local plants, including sinuous indian rubber trees.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

For some of the area’s best beaches, clubs, and snorkeling reefs, head to the rapidly growing city of Playa del Carmen. Farther south, <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1zrvvBM\">Tulum</a> sits on a perch of rocky bluffs and is better known for ancient ruins, including temples and a cliff-side castle. The inhabitants of Tulum—which means &#8220;walled&#8221; in the aboriginal language—first erected the city&#8217;s outer fortress to protect themselves from belligerent invaders. Today, the wall guards the archaeological zone, beginning with an entryway of two corbel arches and a limestone house built over an underwater cave.</p>\n\n<p>Swimming in the secret caves isn’t allowed, but a scenic drive south of Playa del Carmen brings you to the Yucatán Peninsula&#8217;s legendary limestone cenotes, freshwater sinkholes created by an underground river system. At the Cenote Cristalino, you can jump from terraced outcroppings into an exposed pool or go snorkeling in underwater caves. You can also watch locals expertly flip, dive, and synchronously cannonball into the clear water at this popular weekend hangout.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

Yosemite National Park is home to 3 of the world’s 10 tallest waterfalls, the largest piece of exposed granite in the world (known as Half Dome), and a grove of ancient sequoia trees that are among the largest living beings on the planet. </p>\n\n<p>Another popular spot is Lake Tahoe, about 200 miles northeast of San Francisco. The north shore is a popular spot for wine and food festivals in the warmer months, and the south shore is peppered with casinos whose show rooms host everything from live bands to standup comics. South Lake Tahoe is also the starting point for hikes to the base of Lower Eagle Falls. The relatively easy trail reveals breathtaking views of the waterfalls crashing down from above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Los Angeles Area</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kick off your trip by trekking south down the scenic Interstate 5—practically designed for road trips—as it hugs the Pacific coastline and wends past Laguna Beach and Encinitas, taking you all the way to perpetually sunny San Diego. You could also head inland to Palm Springs to check out the area&#8217;s famed midcentury-modern landmarks on a self-guided tour. Stop off for a 2-mile hike through Tahquitz Canyon; the hike&#8217;s finale is the namesake waterfall, which you can swim beneath. </p>\n\n<p>About 40 miles northeast is the nearly 800,000-acre Joshua Tree National Park, which encompasses parts of the Colorado and Mojave Deserts. Take a stroll on 1 of the 12 nature trails for a chance to see native animals, such as desert bighorn sheep, snakes, and black-tailed jackrabbits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Las Vegas Area</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some of the country&#8217;s most scenic national parks are within easy driving distance of Sin City. To the southeast, the Grand Canyon, often considered one of the world&#8217;s seven natural wonders, is a bucket-list-worthy attraction. Most visitors loop around the South Rim for panoramic vistas of the 1-mile-deep canyon. About 170 miles northeast of Vegas lies Zion National Park and its neighbor Bryce Canyon National Park—both Utah parks with otherworldly landscapes. Zion is known for its narrow slot canyons and sandstone cliffs, and Bryce Canyon has spectacular hoodoos—pillars of red rock formed by erosion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Fruits and vegetables come from the onsite organic garden and local farmers on the San Juan Islands.</li>\n  <li>The circa-1898 inn has just a handful of guest <a href=\"http://gr.pn/14cXdr6\">rooms</a>, each of which features a two-person hot tub and vintage-style furnishings.</li>\n  <li>Your stay includes perks like complimentary housemade cookies each afternoon, use of the inn’s bicycles and kayaks, and free WiFi and parking.</li>\n  <li>This Getaway includes a choice between a bottle of sparkling wine and a $25 dining credit to the nearby Coho Restaurant, where chefs craft Pacific Northwest cuisine with a Mediterranean twist.</li>\n  <li>San Juan Island is a nature lover’s paradise. There are hiking trails throughout Lime Kiln Point State Park, located on the other side of the island. You can sometimes spot orca whales from the shore.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Friday Harbor, Washington: Coastal Village and Cultural Hub on San Juan Island</h4>\n\n<p>The San Juan Islands are an archipelago off the coast of northwest Washington in the Salish Sea, the body of water that divides the Washington and from Vancouver Island in Canada. San Juan Island itself is the main hub, home to Friday Harbor—the largest town among the islands. Friday Harbor is also the cultural epicenter, with plenty of art galleries, restaurants, boutiques, and museums.</p>\n\n<p><em>Frommer’s</em> notes that San Juan Island is the only place where “you can reliably see orca whales from shore.” There’s also the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/victoria/the-whale-museum\">Whale Museum</a> in Friday Harbor, where exhibits include the skeleton of a 3-year-old orca and an interactive display on gray whales.</p>\n\n<p>San Juan Island is also historically significant in a peculiar way: In the mid-1800s, Great Britain and the United States clashed over territorial rights to the islands, due to the land’s precarious position between Canada and the United States. After an American soldier killed a British pig in 1859, the boundary dispute came to a head and both sides geared for battle in what became known as the Pig War. Both countries’ troops were at a standoff until 1871, when the Treaty of Washington was signed, granting full possession of the islands to the Americans. Today, you can visit what remains of the former English and American camps—located on opposite sides of the island. Both are designated as part of the San Juan Island National Historical Park and are popular spots to hike nature trails, pick blackberries, and spot wildlife.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Known as the &#8220;Hip Annex&#8221; to Portland and Seattle, Astoria welcomes a number of guests from both areas who come for the emerging brewpub and culinary scene, coffee shops, art, and more. Astoria has a storied past as one of the oldest US settlements west of the Rockies. The town is named after John Jacob Astor, the entrepreneur who founded the Pacific Fur Company and established Fort Astoria in 1811. A few years earlier, in 1805, Lewis and Clark spent a winter camped out at Fort Clatsop; today, a replica fort commemorates the expedition with a visitor’s center and ranger-led programs. Fort Clatsop is also the trailhead for the popular Fort to Sea Trail, a 3-mile hike that wends through forests and across beach dunes en route to the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Today, the land is a reservation for the Wasco, Paiute, and Warm Springs tribes, and they invite guests to come stay amid this relaxing atmosphere. The spring water—which reaches 92 degrees even in winter—now feeds into an outdoor pool with two water slides.</p>\n\n<p>Though the mood is very relaxed, there’s no shortage of things to do. Kids can keep busy with outdoor activities such as mini golf and basketball. Parents may favor trips to the hot-springs-centric spa or rounds of golf on the championship course, which stays open year-round. After a busy day, rest up in a modern <a href=\"http://www.kahneeta.com/rooms.htm\">guest room</a>. Decorated in earth tones to reflect the high-desert environment, each room looks out onto the surrounding valleys and Cascade mountains.</p>\n\n<h4>Warm Springs, Oregon: Kayaking and Mountain Hiking on Native American Reservation</h4>\n\n<p>Located less than two hours east of Portland is Warm Springs, a reservation for the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs consisting of the Tenino, Wasco, and Paiute Native American tribes. The region is marked by high-desert lands thick with forests and interspersed with alpine lakes and deep canyons. The Warm Springs River cuts through the area, making it a popular destination for kayaking, whitewater rafting, and other outdoor pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>The Cascade Mountains to the west help deflect bad weather, resulting in an abundance of sunny days. The typically pleasant weather makes for a perfect setting for hiking, biking, or horseback riding. From mid-July to mid-October, you can hike through Jefferson Park, which has several scenic trails under the shadow of Mount Jefferson, Oregon’s second-tallest mountain after Mount Hood.</p>\n\n<p>For a more in-depth look at the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs’ culture, visit the Museum at Warm Springs, which <em>Frommer’s</em> calls a “fascinating, not-to-be-missed museum.” Here, you can listen to ceremonial songs, explore traditional Native American dwellings, learn about the rituals of a Wasco wedding, or try your hand at traditional hoop dancing, wherein performers tell a story while spinning up to 30 hoops.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

It&#8217;s a scenic setting that influenced the hotel&#8217;s architecture, which resembles a seaport oasis. Guests here may be tempted to linger on their suites&#8217; private balconies to take in the scenery or the harbor&#8217;s famous sunsets, but there are plenty of nearby adventures to take advantage of as well. Bike along the coast, or get your feet wet on a surfing or kayaking excursion. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Spacious suites</strong> feature private balconies, fireplaces, and 42-inch TVs.</li>\n  <li><strong>Savor fresh seafood</strong> and aperitifs at the upscale Oceano Bar and Grill. </li>\n  <li><strong>Sink into a milk-and-honey bath</strong> at the onsite <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1ByqCHf\">spa</a>, which uses organic products in its treatments. </li>\n  <li><strong>Eco-friendly</strong>: Conscious of the region&#8217;s scenic beauty, the hotel is dedicated to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1llmEJY\">earth-friendly practices</a>, including using natural light in public areas.</li>\n  <li><strong>Shops at Harbor Village</strong>: Browse more than two dozen boutiques and restaurants in this greenhouse-style shopping center, located just off the lobby. </li>\n  <li><strong>Downtown San Francisco</strong> is about 40 minutes away by car.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Half Moon Bay, California: Historical Town on the Bay Area Peninsula</h4>\n\n<p>Charming buildings dating back to the 19th century line Main Street in Half Moon Bay, a seaside town on a peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco. Half Moon Bay is largely rural, but it’s close to Silicon Valley, spurring business owners to move upscale restaurants, galleries, and boutiques into those century-old buildings. Local farms and coastal wineries supply eateries with seasonal fare and tasty varietals.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the town&#8217;s main attractions can be found along its gorgeous coastline. At Fitzgerald Marine Reserve, small pools fill up along the shore at low tide, revealing hermit crabs and starfish. You can explore the area&#8217;s rocky terrain on your own or follow along with a volunteer naturalist, who will gladly point out critters in the sandy coves and monterey cypress trees in the forest. Locals also enjoy spending time at Half Moon Bay State Beach, a 4-mile stretch of oceanfront sand known for its summertime fog in the mornings and evenings.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Millions of annual visitors from all over the world would beg to differ. It&#8217;s especially beautiful at night, when it twinkles with 20,000 lights.</li>\n  <li><strong>Notre-Dame Cathedral</strong>: This 12th-century church towers over the Seine and marks the unofficial center of Paris. Its Gothic spires and gargoyles were immortalized in Victor Hugo&#8217;s <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat like a local</strong>: Stop at any of the myriad sidewalk pastry vendors to try buttery croissants filled with chocolate, handmade crepes, tarts, and more.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional tours</strong>: Tour the Louvre Museum ($67/person), Versailles Apartments ($93/person), or the Paris Seinorama (including a visit to the Eiffel Tower; $74/person).

Get inside the London Eye ferris wheel&#8217;s glass pods to see the city and the River Thames from 443 feet up.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Arts and culture</strong>: The building that houses the Tate Modern was once a power station. Now it contains 20th-century masterpieces by Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Pablo Picasso.</li>\n  <li><strong>Iconic architecture</strong>: Built after the Great Fire of 1666, the 18th-century St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral is Sir Christopher Wren&#8217;s best-known work. <em>Frommer&#8217;s</em> calls the domed church the &#8220;defining landmark of the city skyline.&#8221;</li>\n  <li><strong>Out of the ordinary</strong>: Pollock&#8217;s Toy Museum houses a quirky collection of wax figurines, early teddy bears, puppets, and mechanical toys from the Victorian age.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat like a local</strong>: Sprinkle salt and vinegar on your fish and chips or nosh on traditional bangers and mash dripping with onion gravy. Other traditional British dishes include hearty beef Wellington and steak-and-kidney pie.</li>\n  <li><strong>Grab a pint</strong> at a neighborhood pub—London has approximately 7,000 of them.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional tours</strong>: Add a morning tour of London with a river cruise ($57/person), a trip to the London Eye ($32/person), or a full-day tour of Windsor, Stonehenge, and Bath ($159/person).

The resort is geared toward fun-loving families as well as laid-back visitors looking to be pampered in paradise. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Room with a view</strong>: Sian Kaan or Pyramid rooms overlook the Caribbean Sea or Nichupte Lagoon (subject to availability). Each unit features a mini bar, Bvlgari bath products, and high-speed Internet.</li>\n  <li><strong>All-inclusive privileges</strong> cover three daily meals, unlimited beverages, and a welcome bottle of wine.</li>\n  <li><strong>29 restaurants and 20 bars</strong>: Among the wealth of dining and drinking options: an international buffet, cocktail lounges, sports bars, swim-up bars, and a la carte restaurants serving seafood, sushi, barbecue, Mexican, Mediterranean, and Italian cuisine.</li>\n  <li><strong>See Chichen Itza</strong> on an excursion included with this Groupon.</li>\n  <li><strong>Daily entertainment</strong>: The resort employs a cast of more than 50 singers, acrobats, and comedians dedicated to keeping guests happy.</li>\n  <li><strong>Enormous pool</strong> winding through tropical gardens</li>\n  <li><strong>Tee off</strong> on the par 3 9-hole course.</li>\n  <li><strong>Additional discounts</strong>: Guests get 15% off spa treatments; 20% off smart car rentals; 10% off wine menu list and premium beverages; 10% off lobster dinner, romantic dinners, red circus, and special events; and other perks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Cancún: Cool White Sands and Mayan Relics</h4>\n\n<p>Located on a barrier island shaped like the number seven, Cancún&#8217;s Hotel Zone juts into the Caribbean Sea at the northeast tip of Mexico&#8217;s Yucatán Peninsula. With the sea on one side and freshwater lagoons on the other, it&#8217;s a popular spot for sailing and snorkeling. Although the beaches and barrier reefs are a major draw, the geography is equally enticing further inland, where you can dive into an underground river or take a speedboat through a mangrove jungle.</p>\n\n<p>Cancún pulls in millions of visitors each year, so escaping the crowds and the party atmosphere isn&#8217;t always easy, but a visit to Playa Delfines offers a chance for sunbathing in relative seclusion. Resorts have yet to encroach upon this stretch of sand, and it&#8217;s especially popular with surfers.</p>\n\n<p>The stone columns of El Rey Ruins, an ancient Mayan site dating back to the second and third centuries BCE, lie within the city’s Hotel Zone. Believed to be a royal burial ground, the archaeological site is also home to wild iguanas that lounge in the sun and read Tom Clancy novels. For a Mayan-themed day trip, take a 1.5-hour drive from Cancún down the coast to <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1zrvvBM\">Tulum</a>, a pre-Columbian walled city located on a bluff overlooking the sea—one of the Yucatán Peninsula&#8217;s most visited Mayan ruins. The Mayan city of Chichén Itzá, chosen as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007, is only a 2.5-hour drive from Cancún.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. What is the best way to travel to the hotel from the airport?</strong> Cancún International Airport (CUN) is 20–30 minutes from the property.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Is there an additional occupancy fee, or do I have to purchase another Groupon?</strong> The Groupon covers two guests. Adding occupants above standard is $80 per night for each additional guest 3 or older; kids 2 or younger stay free.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Will I be approached to attend a timeshare sales presentation?</strong> Groupon customers are never obligated to attend a sales presentation. If you are approached and decline a presentation, you will not lose the value of your Groupon or have to pay additional fees.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Which activities and amenities are included in the resort credits?</strong> Resort credits are not included with the Groupon.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

There are ways to explore the scenic landscape all year round. In the warm seasons, hiking, biking, and golf are popular pastimes. In the winter, you can hit the slopes of British Columbia&#8217;s second largest ski resort. Pinnacle Lodge even has ski-in, ski-out access to trails on Mount Morrisey. </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Skiing season</strong>: November 21–April 10</li>\n  <li><strong>Number of trails and glades</strong>: 133 across three mountains—Tod, Sundance, and Morrisey</li>\n  <li><strong>Raise your glass</strong>: There are more than 120 wineries in the region.</li>\n  <li><strong>In-room amenities</strong>: mini refrigerator, balcony, and fireplace</li>\n  <li><strong>Complimentary eats</strong>: daily breakfast and afternoon tea (included in $18 per day resort fee) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Sun Peaks, British Columbia: Ski Slopes Steps from Charming Resort Town</h4>\n\n<p>No matter where you turn in Sun Peaks, you can see the mountains; they tower majestically, seemingly from all angles. The town has ski-in and ski-out access to nearly 3,700 acres of downhill slopes; Olympic champion and Canadian Senator Nancy Greene often leads tours of the trails. After the snow melts in early summer, the mountains come alive with bikers and hikers. You can catch a ride up the mountain with your bike on Sunburst Chairlift, open daily from late June through Labor Day. From the top, there are 36 mountain-biking trails to choose from, plus a dirt-jumping zone.</p>\n\n<p>The chairlift will also drop off hikers at a more moderate elevation, from which they can access 15 hiking trails. From mid-July to mid-August, the vibrant hillside meadows are covered with wildflowers such as tiger lilies and the mauve-colored fireweed. Keep an eye out for resident wildlife, including black bears, coyotes, moose, cougars, and bald eagles.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The secluded town is one of the island&#8217;s smallest—<i>Lonely Planet</i> calls it &#8220;a one-street village”—and it&#8217;s noticeably quieter than its tourist-clogged neighbors. But what it lacks in size Runaway Bay makes up in natural attractions. Some of the best underwater sights in the Caribbean can be explored during scuba-diving tours of the coral reef just offshore. And about 4 miles (7 km) west of town, you can explore the limestone vaults and subterranean lakes of the Green Grotto Caves, which were used as a hideout by Spanish die-hards during Jamaica&#8217;s 18th-century colonization by the English.</p>\n\n<p>A scenic 25-minute drive brings you to one of the island&#8217;s most popular attractions—Dunn&#8217;s River Falls. This natural wonder consists of a series of terraced waterfalls cascading from the mountains to the sea like a gigantic flight of stairs. Thousands of travelers visit the site each year, and it even served as a filming location for the first James Bond movie, <em>Dr. No</em>. Today, tour groups frolic at the bottom of the falls or make the 600-foot climb to the top behind local guides.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. What is the best way to travel to the hotel from the airport?</strong> Sangster International Airport (MBJ) is the closest airport. There is a free shuttle.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Is there an additional occupancy fee, or do I have to purchase another Groupon?</strong> The Groupon covers two guests.

Will I be approached to attend a timeshare sales presentation?</strong> Groupon customers are never obligated to attend a sales presentation. If you are approached and decline a presentation, you will not lose the value of your Groupon or have to pay additional fees.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Which activities and amenities are included in the resort credits?</strong> Resort credits are not included with the Groupon.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

Guests can snuggle up around the outdoor fire pit to watch the brilliant display. As an official Disneyland Good Neighbor Hotel, the property sells discounted park passes through the front desk. You can walk to the theme park&#8217;s main gate—less than one block away—or take advantage of the Anaheim Resort Transit bus system, which stops in front of the hotel.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Where you&#8217;ll stay</strong>: <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1tfPqod\">Guest rooms</a> come with refrigerator, microwave, iPod docking station, flat-screen TV, Keurig coffeemaker, and free WiFi</li>\n  <li><strong>Onsite dining</strong>: The hotel&#8217;s newly remodeled restaurant serves all-American favorites and showcases their smoothies.</li>\n  <li><strong>Head to Long Beach</strong> to play volleyball, tour the <em>Queen Mary</em>, or make a sandcastle—it&#8217;s just 15 miles away.</li>\n  <li><strong>Make a splash</strong> in the heated outdoor pool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Anaheim, California: Magical Play Land About a Half Hour from Huntington Beach</h4>\n\n<p>Less than an hour from Hollywood and Universal Studios, Anaheim is perfectly situated for making the most of a Southern California getaway. But most visitors never make it that far, as Disneyland Park has long dominated the city’s tourism scene. As Walt Disney’s original park, it has a handful of classic attractions that, though upgraded over the years, have been around since the park opened in 1955. You can ride the Mad Tea Party spinning teacups, hop on the King Arthur Carrousel, or sail in the Storybook Land Canal Boats (Walt Disney personally planted the small pine near Geppetto’s home).</p>\n\n<p>Disneyland Park has plenty of modern rides too, including Cars Land, one of the newer additions to Disney California Adventure Park and a life-size re-creation of the town from Disney Pixar’s <em>Cars</em>. The highlight here is the slot-car attraction, which puts you in an automated vehicle that swerves around animatronic characters before engaging another car in a high-speed race.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the mood for thrills, ascend the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror before dropping in a heart-pounding free fall, or climb aboard the roller coasters thundering around Paradise Pier with sweeping views of the park. Alternatively, trade fairy dust for white sand in Huntington Beach, where you&#8217;ll find 3.5 miles of free-to-the-public beaches filled with surfing, pickup volleyball games, and countless stalls hawking flip-flops and seashell-themed wares.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Tour guides lead groups through the falls, and you can swim and occasionally slide down the natural water slides.</p>\n\n<p>You can get an aerial view of Puerto Plata and the Caribbean Sea on a teleférico, or cable car. One of them climbs 2,565 feet to the apex of Mount Isabel de Torres, which is crowned with blooming botanical gardens and a replica of Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s massive <em>Christ the Redeemer</em> statue. It&#8217;s also worth it to take a scenic drive to Parque Histórico La Isabela, where you&#8217;ll find the remains of a church as well as ruins of a colonial village where Columbus routinely woke his neighbors by blasting the <i>Santa Maria</i>&#8217;s foghorn.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

To that end, the resort—built from trees toppled by a hurricane—stocks only biodegradable soaps and uses an underground electricity system to avoid disturbing local wildlife. Its nine private casitas even blend in with the surrounding foliage. Each two-story unit is raised off the ground, featuring a thatched roof and slatted façades, affecting the appearance of a contemporary treehouse. The resort’s eco-friendly attitude and stunning scenery helped the island earn a spot on <em>Travel + Leisure</em>&#8217;s list of the Best Secret Islands on Earth.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Named in the top 25</strong> World&#8217;s Best Ecolodges by <em>National Geographic</em>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stylish accommodations</strong>: Relax on your private deck&#8217;s oversized hammock while enjoying views of the lake, foliage, and Mombacho Volcano. Inside, each unit is decorated with locally made furniture crafted from Rainforest Alliance-certified wood.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch chefs at work</strong> in the open-air kitchen at the onsite restaurant as they prepare grass-fed steak with chimichurri sauce and bananas foster pancakes. Though the menu changes frequently, the restaurant stays dedicated to using locally sourced ingredients.</li>\n  <li><strong>All meals, snacks, and nonalcoholic beverages included</strong> with this Groupon.</li>\n  <li><strong>Outdoor adventure</strong>: The staff can help schedule numerous tours, including nature hikes, zipline rides, and cultural experiences. To explore on your own, borrow a kayak or standup paddleboard for free and paddle around the islets&#8217; canals. </li>\n  <li><strong>Practice sun salutations</strong> during yoga classes on the resort&#8217;s dedicated yoga deck, which overlooks Lake Nicaragua and offers views of the Mombacho Volcano.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pamper yourself</strong> with a shiatsu or hot-stone massage in the resort&#8217;s open-air treatment rooms, which are outfitted with private showers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Granada Isletas, Nicaragua: Volcanic Islands Off the Shores of an Old Colonial Town</h4>\n\n<p>Jicaro Island is one of the Granada Isletas, which are more than 300 small volcanic-rock islands in an archipelago just off the coast of Granada. Visitors arrive on the island by motorboat, and it’s easy to explore the rest of the islets by simply hopping in a kayak. One of the mainland&#8217;s highlights is the nearby Mombacho Volcano, a stratovolcano that many climb for fantastic views of Lake Nicaragua. Mombacho has varied ecosystems, including both high-altitude cloud forests and low-altitude dry forests. The volcano is also home to a wide variety of animals, including howler monkeys and iguanas.</p>\n\n<p>The closest city to Jicaro Island is Granada, founded in 1524 by Spanish colonists. Today, the city offers a glimpse of the old Spanish empire at the height of its powers: there are restored cathedrals, colorful squares, and glistening bell towers. Old-fashioned horse carriages still mosey through the city’s cobblestone streets, and vendors showcase hand-carved wood toys and jewelry in the central plaza.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. What is the best way to travel to the hotel from the airport?</strong> Granada, Nicaragua is about 26 miles from Augusto C. Sandino International Airport in Managua (MGA).

Yet Santa Barbara stands out among the pack, thanks to its prime location: it’s sandwiched between Pacific beaches to the west and the Santa Ynez Mountains to the east. With a population of 90,000, it&#8217;s urban, but not overly so—the charming downtown corridor along State Street is a steady parade of mom-and-pop shops, cafes, bars, art galleries, and movie theaters. </p>\n\n<p>A subtle Mediterranean influence graces most buildings: think red-tile roofs, stucco facades, and Moorish-style arches. The climate is breezy and warm year-round, providing an environment for lush tropical foliage to thrive; it&#8217;s easy to see why the city bills itself as &#8220;The American Riviera.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>To see where it all started, head to the historic Old Mission Santa Barbara, founded in 1786 by a Franciscan friar. Docents offer guided tours of the mission, which houses an art gallery, Native American artifacts, and period furniture. Around the corner, Mission Canyon is a popular trailhead for several hikes in the front range of the Santa Ynez Mountains. Try the 3.5-mile round-trip trek to Inspiration Point for scenic views of the Santa Barbara coastline and the Channel Islands off the coast.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

On this 7-day tour, the walled seaside town of Termoli will serve as your home base between hands-on cooking classes and culinary tours around the countryside. The sightseeing tours give you a break from the kitchen and show a side of Italy not seen on most tour itineraries. All your meals are included, and you&#8217;ll sample some of the area&#8217;s best gourmet cuisine. This tour includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>6 nights of accommodations in a deluxe room at Residenza Sveva in Termoli</li>\n  <li>Six breakfasts, lunches, and dinners</li>\n  <li>Round-trip airport transfers</li>\n  <li>Cooking and wine-pairing classes</li>\n  <li>Sightseeing tours</li>\n  <li>Fish-market, olive-mill, and cheese-making tours</li>\n  <li>Airfare is not included with this Groupon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See the full itinerary <a href=\"http://www.epitourean.com/master/415/Old-Abruzzi-The-Adriatic-Culinary-Holiday\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Culinary-Tour Highlights</h4>\n\n<h5>Cooking Classes</h5>\n\n<p>Savor Abruzzo&#8217;s storied flavors during four cooking classes. Learn to stuff vegetables and make simple, rustic dishes in the peasant-food class. In another class, you&#8217;ll make pasta by hand and infuse it with the earthy flavors of truffles. The last two topics covered are antipasti—a traditional appetizer plate of smoked meats, cheeses, and seafood—and handmade pizzas.</p>\n\n<h5>Cheese-Making Tour</h5>\n\n<p>In Agnone, you&#8217;ll visit a factory where artisans will demonstrate how to make fresh mozzarella cheese. You&#8217;ll also get to snack a bit—the tour includes samples.</p>\n\n<h5>Vasto Day Trip</h5>\n\n<p>The quiet seaside town of Vasto is perched beside the Adriatic Sea. It&#8217;s home to a handful of traboccos, or fishing houses jutting out into the water. A little farther inland, you can take a stroll on a quiet beach and shop in the town&#8217;s boutiques.</p>\n\n<h5>Olive-Mill Tour</h5>\n\n<p>The prestigious olive producer that you&#8217;ll visit counts Williams-Sonoma and Dean &amp; DeLuca among its customers. Here, you&#8217;ll learn how extra-virgin olive oil is made before enjoying lunch amid the olive groves. Afterward, you&#8217;ll be treated to an olive-oil tasting.</p>\n\n<h4>Where You&#8217;ll Stay</h4>\n\n<p>Each room at Residenza Sveva features a Mediterranean color palette, marble-painted walls, and a fully stocked mini bar. The hotel offers albergo diffuso accommodations, meaning its individually appointed rooms are located in four buildings in Termoli&#8217;s old town. Termoli&#8217;s quiet beaches and port are within walking distance of each building, as is the 12th-century, Puglian Romanesque cathedral. A little farther inland, you can tour the 13th-century Castello Svevo.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. How much would it cost to fly from an airport not listed as part of this deal?</strong><br />\nAirfare is not included in this offer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Can we extend our trip before or after the promotional dates for the deal?</strong><br /> Contact Epitourean for details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How do I find out if the dates I want to travel are available?</strong><br />\nGroupon customers should call 800-390-3292 or email customerservice@epitourean.com to inquire about desired dates. Customers should be a little flexible in choosing their dates. Epitourean will do everything possible to accommodate the requested dates, but we also run this tour virtually every week throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What happens if I buy the Groupon and my travel dates are not available?</strong><br />\nIf the dates requested by the customer are not available, they can request flexible dates so that they can use their voucher for a future date (where we honor the discounted price and pre-paid status), or they can request a refund through Groupon, as long as it is within the Groupon refund period.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Does my child need a Groupon, and can they stay in my room?</strong><br />\nThis package is sold on a per person basis regardless of age. Due to the nature of the cooking class focus of these tours, we do not recommend kids under the age of 14. But kids pay the same price as adults in this particular package.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.  Is the price advertised available on every date?</strong><br />\nContact Epitourean for details.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Nowhere else in the world will you find as many famous amusement parks, from Walt Disney World® Theme Parks to Universal Orlando Resort. Located in Orlando’s neighboring city, Kissimmee, Florida Deluxe Villas provides upscale condos that are spacious enough to house the whole family. From here, you&#8217;re within a 20-minute drive of all the parks.</p>\n\n<p>Two- and three-bedroom condos have eat-in kitchens, washers and dryers, and large living rooms. You’ll also find clubhouses outfitted with fitness centers, hot tubs, pools, game rooms, and saunas. Check the Florida Deluxe Villas <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1ucqXML\">website</a> for a complete list of available units.</p>\n\n<p>A concierge is on hand to help you plan your time. As an authorized independent retailer for Walt Disney World® Theme Parks, the concierge can sell park tickets directly, as well as discounted admission to other area attractions and dinner shows. After a day at the parks, use your included Restaurant.com gift card to grab dinner at a nearby eatery.</p>\n\n<h4>Kissimmee, Florida: Easy Access to World-Famous Theme Parks and Major Orlando Attractions</h4>\n\n<p>Located on the banks of Lake Tohopekaliga, Kissimmee sits about 22 miles from downtown Orlando and just 16 miles from the Walt Disney World® Theme Parks. The world’s most-visited entertainment resort spans roughly 30,000 acres, encompassing four theme parks, two water parks, five golf courses, and the Downtown Disney® Area. There’s no shortage of things to do here: begin your day at Magic Kingdom® Park by boarding Space Mountain® Attraction, a rocket-shaped three-seater that climbs to 180 feet before entering a deep black tunnel and racing past stars, satellites, and constellations. After that, ride past the ghastly goofballs inside The Haunted Mansion. For dinner, head over to Epcot® to sample cuisine from Morocco, Mexico, France, Italy, and several other countries at the World Showcase. As one of the most popular family destinations in the world, sunny Orlando is home to other theme parks including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando.</p>\n\n<p>Those hoping to shake up the typical theme-park-dominated itinerary can head into downtown Orlando&#8217;s vibrant arts district. The neighborhood boasts venues such as the CityArts Factory, a multifaceted patchwork of gallery spaces, and <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/sak-comedy-lab\">SAK Comedy Lab</a>, which holds improv shows five nights a week.</p>\n\n<p>About a 10-minute drive north, you’ll find several cultural institutions surrounding Loch Haven Park, including the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/orlando-museum-of-art\">Orlando Museum of Art</a>; the collection features pieces by Georgia O’Keeffe, Robert Rauschenberg, Ansel Adams, and Andy Warhol. The park is also home to the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/orlando-shakespeare-theater\">Orlando Shakespeare Theater</a> and the Orlando Science Center, where you can take a rover across a simulation of Mars or race model cars down a 70-foot pinewood-derby track.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

It&#8217;s tucked away atop a century-old building in downtown Seattle, within easy walking distance of Pike Place Market and surrounded by views of the Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Inside, the inn draws inspiration from Europe, with several antique furnishings that were imported from Sussex, England.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>A bistro-style breakfast</strong> of freshly baked breads, fruit, and coffee helps you start your day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stylish rooms and suites</strong> are trimmed in elegant turn-of-the-century furnishings, but free WiFi keeps you in touch with the modern world.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bring Fido!</strong>: Pets can tag along for an additional fee. The innkeeper&#8217;s cavalier king charles spaniel, Theo, is likely to welcome you when you arrive. </li>\n  <li><strong>Watch the sunset</strong>: The hotel is known for its stunning views of Elliott Bay&#8217;s sunsets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Downtown Seattle: Art, Architecture, and Famous Coffee in Coastal Urban Center</h4>\n\n<p>Street performances, flowers, and fresh-caught fish find a common home at Seattle’s <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1yUWZo4\">Pike Place Market</a>. Founded in 1907, this market is where both sightseers and locals shop for fresh seafood, meat, and produce. Drop into the Fish Market to watch the staff tossing salmon, halibut, cod—a famous tradition. There are plenty of nonperishable goods as well, including jewelry and other crafts. And you might want to take a picture in front of the market’s iconic sign, which now rivals Space Needle as the city’s most-recognizable symbol.</p>\n\n<p>The original Starbucks coffeehouse has operated out of Pike Place since the 1970s. You can stop here for a pick-me-up before taking the half-mile walk to Seattle Central Library. Whether you love books or architecture or both, this futuristic-looking library is worth a visit. The 11-story glass-and-steel structure consists almost entirely of diamond-shaped windows arranged to look like a geometric net. The otherworldly interior is a playground for book lovers. Be sure to check out the library’s “living room” in the morning, when sunlight creates a kaleidoscopic shadow on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Like the library, the nearby <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/seattle/seattle-art-museum\">Seattle Art Museum</a> is full of spectacles, starting with its collection of “exploding” white Ford Tauruses suspended from the lobby ceiling. Exhibits range from Renaissance-era European art to Korean and Japanese panels.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

","highlightsHtml":"<p>4-star 1920s hotel has modern decor and Andy Warhol artwork; steps from Broadway theaters in Times Square</p>","pitchHtml":"<h4>Four-Star Modern Hotel in Times Square</h4>\n\n<p>The chic Paramount Hotel was built in 1928 and then transformed by Ian Schrager, cofounder of Studio 54. The building still has its ornate façade, but much of the interior has been recently updated. The hotel is located right in Times Square, just steps from all of the Broadway theaters—which might explain why past guests have included stars such as Liza Minnelli and Daniel Radcliffe. </p>\n\n<p>The refreshed <a href=\"http://www.nycparamount.com/guest-rooms\">guest rooms</a> feature clean lines, handsome decor, and bathrooms with Philippe Starck–designed stainless-steel sinks shaped like ice-cream cones. Because of the building’s old-fashioned layout, rooms tend to run small in size; stay in one of the deluxe king rooms for a little more space. On the ground floor just around the corner from the lobby, the sleek <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1hK1ZTI\">Paramount Bar &amp; Grill</a> serves continental cuisine and innovative cocktails.</p>\n\n<h4>Times Square, Manhattan: Flashy Neon Lights and World-Class Culture</h4>\n\n<p>Times Square is located at the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The famous address—affectionately known as “the Crossroads of the World”—is home to hypnotizing billboards, giant wraparound news tickers, and the neon lights of Broadway. Beyond the glitz and gimmicks, there are a number of world-class cultural offerings in the area, ranging from museums to Michelin-rated restaurants. Buildings of historical and architectural interest include the Paramount Building and One Times Square, site of the annual New Year&#8217;s Eve ball drop.</p>\n\n<p>Nearby, the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/new-york-city/the-modern\">Museum of Modern Art</a> houses a trove of masterpieces including Vincent van Gogh&#8217;s <em>The Starry Night</em>, Claude Monet&#8217;s waterlily paintings, and Andy Warhol&#8217;s <em>Campbell&#8217;s Soup Cans</em>. Save time for a stroll through the museum&#8217;s outdoor sculpture garden, where dazzling installations are clustered around sparkling reflecting pools. About a mile north of Times Square, the David H. Koch Theater is home to one of the world’s foremost dance companies—the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/new-york-city/new-york-city-ballet\">New York City Ballet</a>, which stages contemporary works as well as classics like <em>Swan Lake</em> and <em>The Nutcracker</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

This subtropical climate makes the island a haven for outdoor-sports enthusiasts, especially golfers, who can choose from dozens of championship courses and tennis players, who have the option to reserve one of twenty courts located immediately next door. Additionally, more than 50 miles&#8217; worth of bike and rollerblade pathways crisscross the island, many of them leading to Hilton Head&#8217;s wealth of justly lauded beaches.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The famous ads for Calvin Klein’s Obsession perfume starring Kate Moss were shot on the rooftop terrace here; the campaign helped cement South Beach’s popularity and the hotel&#8217;s status as &#8220;the crown jewel of Ocean Drive,&#8221; as <em>Frommer&#8217;s</em> calls it. And it&#8217;s just across the street from a white-sand beach along the ocean.</p>\n\n<p>Built in 1936, the iconic hotel recently underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation to preserve its art-deco exterior as well as the lobby’s colorful marble floors. Everything else received a 21st-century upgrade, including the installation of a plunge pool with an infinity edge. Brand-new <a href=\"http://breakwaterhotelsouthbeach.com/rooms/\">guest rooms</a> come furnished with white patent-leather benches and elaborately patterned headboards, as well as 42-inch flat-screen TVs and WiFi. Choose a junior suite for the most space, or a deluxe room for a balcony.</p>\n\n<p>Just steps away, you’ll find Lummus Park and its popular beach—a hangout for the likes of Will Smith, Jennifer Lopez, and other celebrities. The palm-studded pathways lining Lummus Park are perfect for cruising on one of the hotel’s bicycles. After working up an appetite playing beach volleyball or touring the surrounding art-deco district, you can grab dinner at one of the hotel’s two restaurants. <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1FARlda\">Il Paparazzi</a> specializes in Italian cuisine prepared with pastas and cheeses made in-house, and <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1ej4Tj4\">Ocean’s Ten</a> serves an eclectic mix of American food at indoor and outdoor dining areas, with nightly entertainment.</p>\n\n<h4>Miami&#8217;s South Beach: World-Famous Nightlife and Art-Deco Icons</h4>\n\n<p>Just east of downtown Miami, on the barrier island that forms Miami Beach, you&#8217;ll find one of the world&#8217;s nightlife capitals: South Beach. The clubs along Ocean Drive are legendary for their boisterous, all-night blowouts—and for good reason. With all the rum-soaked mojitos, colorful neon, and celebrity sightings, it can feel like an endless party. Perhaps that&#8217;s why the area pops up so often in film and TV shows, including <em>Burn Notice</em> and ­<em>The Birdcage</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The coast of South Beach is known as Lummus Park, which <em>Frommer&#8217;s</em> calls Miami&#8217;s &#8220;best beach for people-watching.&#8221; While the bleached sand and curving palms are gorgeous, they&#8217;re almost overshadowed by the chiseled beach-goers dotting the sand. From here, a wood-slat boardwalk runs all the way up to North Beach, attracting joggers and roller bladers. Head across the bay, to South Pointe Park or Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, for quieter, more secluded shores.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy enough to spend the entirety of a trip to South Beach face-down on a beach towel, but that would mean missing out on the city&#8217;s other offerings. The famous art-deco district, with its iconic, streamlined hotels in pastel shades, was the first 20th-century neighborhood to be recognized by the National Register of Historic Places. Every morning at 10:30, local experts from the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/miami-beach-fl/miami-design-preservation-league\">Miami Design Preservation League</a> lead a 90-minute walking tour that highlights the neighborhood&#8217;s signature architecture.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Each has a private riverfront deck, too.</li>\n  <li>The resort is ideal for a romantic getaway—after a day of exploring the Rockies, you can relax under the stars in the outdoor hot tub. </li>\n  <li>This Groupon includes a tasting for two at Snowy Peaks Winery.</li>\n  <li>In downtown Estes Park, you can shop at quaint boutiques and art shops on Elkhorn Avenue and nibble on homemade fudge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Estes Park, Colorado: Gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park</h4>\n\n<p>At an elevation of 7,522 feet, Estes Park is a small mountain town known as the eastern gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park. Along Elkhorn Avenue, the main drag of downtown Estes Park, you’ll find the usual souvenir, taffy, and ice-cream shops—but also local breweries and independent restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>Each year, more than three million people head into Rocky Mountain National Park to access 300 miles of hiking trails and admire stunning mountain vistas. The park’s most popular hike is the half-mile loop around the flat terrain of Bear Lake, but the crowd thins out somewhat if you continue onto Nymph, Dream, and Emerald Lakes. Park trails are often covered with snow, but you can strap on a pair of snowshoes and make the trek to the alpine lake at The Loch or the summit of Deer Mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Weather permitting, consider taking one of region’s spectacular scenic drives. One option is the Peak to Peak Scenic Byway, which wends past the Continental Divide, offering views of Longs Peak—the park’s highest summit, at 14,259 feet. Before you embark on any drive, be sure to check the road status report.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The hotel first welcomed guests during the World’s Columbian Exposition. Over the next 50 years, it was furnished with glamorous ballrooms and stylish supper clubs. Now the hotel’s chief advantage is its superb location in downtown Chicago, where it stands along Michigan Avenue. It’s just minutes from Grant Park, several world-class museums, and a host of luxury retail stores.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Onsite dining</strong>: Rafael&#8217;s Restaurant serves gourmet burgers, roasted duck breast with orange sauce, and other specialties. In the morning, you can enjoy a hearty American breakfast at the Gazebo Restaurant.</li>\n  <li><strong>Presidential guests</strong>: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Richard Nixon</li>\n  <li><strong>Work up a sweat</strong> in the 24-hour fitness room.</li>\n  <li><strong>Get some culture</strong> across the street at the Auditorium Theatre, which offers musical performances, plays, and ballet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Chicago&#8217;s Loop: Historic Commercial Center with World-Class Museums and Parks</h4>\n\n<p>Named after the shape formed by the elevated train tracks that form its perimeter, The Loop is Chicago&#8217;s downtown and the country’s second-largest business district. Skyscrapers such as the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) and the art-deco Chicago Board of Trade Building loom large here. They overlook waterfront parks, a glitzy theater district, and some of the world’s finest art collections.</p>\n\n<p>About three blocks from the hotel is the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/chicago/the-art-institute-of-chicago\">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, whose gargantuan collection covers everything from marble busts and sarcophagi to modern masterpieces such as Edward Hopper&#8217;s <em>Nighthawks</em> and Grant Wood&#8217;s <em>American Gothic</em>. You don’t even have to go to the museum to see outstanding art—walk around The Loop, and you’ll see outdoor sculptures from Picasso and Joan Miró. Just north of the Art Institute, Millennium Park is known for both the Frank Gehry-designed Pritzker Pavilion (which hosts free public concerts during the summer), and for the sculpture <em>Cloud Gate</em>, known to Chicagoans as “The Bean” for its legume-like shape.  </p>\n\n<p>Grant Park, known affectionately as &#8220;Chicago&#8217;s front yard,&#8221; occupies more than 300 acres along the lake just east of the Loop. Modeled after the gardens at Versailles, the park is dotted with several impressive attractions, including Buckingham Fountain, the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Adler Planetarium. Its sheer size have made Grant Park the site of many notable events, including Barack Obama’s 2008 victory speech and the Lollapalooza music festival, which takes place here every summer.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

You&#8217;ll experience Spanish nightlife, admire Italian art, and experience British history. With no set itinerary, you&#8217;ll have time to explore five cities in three different countries on your own, leaving you free to spend an afternoon gazing at the Colosseum in Rome or sipping wine in Barcelona&#8217;s Gothic Quarter. Each option <a href=\"http://gr.pn/21gvyBc\">includes</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Included in all options:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Round-trip airfare from New York (specific gateway based on availability)</li>\n  <li>3 nights of standard accommodations at the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1htHkyi\">Silken St. Gervasi</a> or similar in Barcelona</li>\n  <li>Flight from Barcelona to Rome</li>\n  <li>3 nights of standard accommodations at the 4-star <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1igpUgw\">Holiday Inn Rome Pisana</a> or similar in Rome</li>\n  <li>Second-class rail from Rome to Florence</li>\n  <li>3 nights of standard accommodations at the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1hyM9wE\">Hotel Meridiana</a> or similar in Florence</li>\n  <li>Second-class rail from Florence to Venice</li>\n  <li>2 nights of standard accommodations at the 4-star <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1DrpY6m\">Smart Hotel Holiday</a> or similar in Venice</li>\n  <li>Flight from Venice to London</li>\n  <li>3 nights of standard accommodations at <a href=\"http://www.myplacehotel.co.uk/\">My Place Hotel</a> or similar in London</li>\n  <li>14 breakfasts</li>\n  <li>Hop on/hop off tour in each city (a walking tour of Venice) available from $170 per person</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Barcelona</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Picasso Museum</strong>: With 4,251 paintings, this museum houses the world&#8217;s most extensive collection of art by Pablo Picasso, including the entire 58-painting <em>Las Meninas</em> collection.</li>\n  <li><strong>Witness history in the making</strong> at La Sagrada Familia, a whimsical Antoni Gaudí–designed church that has slowly taken shape over 130 years; it&#8217;s estimated to be finished—finally—by 2026. </li>\n  <li><strong>Eat like a local</strong>: Fresh mussels, fried calamari, and shrimp paella are staples here. Pair your favorite dish with a glass of cava, Spain&#8217;s take on champagne.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Rome</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>See the Colosseum</strong>: Built in AD 72, this amphitheater hosted some of the Roman Empire&#8217;s bloodiest gladiator battles. </li>\n  <li><strong>Tour Vatican City</strong>: The expansive gardens alone are reason enough to visit. Perhaps the main draw, though, is the Sistine Chapel, whose famous ceiling was painted by Michelangelo.</li>\n  <li><strong>St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica</strong>: Also in Vatican City, the world&#8217;s largest Christian church can hold up to 60,000 people. It houses work by Michelangelo and Bernini.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Florence</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Michelangelo&#8217;s <em>David</em></strong> is on display at the Galleria dell&#8217;Accademia. After taking in the lifelike musculature of this 14-foot-tall white marble masterpiece, check out the artist&#8217;s unfinished <em>Prisoners</em> sculptures.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Duomo di Firenze</strong> stands out amid Florence&#8217;s architecture. The church is topped with a striking red dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Venice</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Doge&#8217;s Palace</strong>: Once the residence of the city&#8217;s supreme ruler, this 14th-century Venetian Gothic icon today serves as a museum celebrating Venice&#8217;s history and culture.</li>\n  <li><strong>Grand Canal</strong>: Gondolas snake through the city&#8217;s heart on one of the world&#8217;s most famous waterways, which laps historic palaces and landmarks, including the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark&#8217;s Square.</li>\n  <li><strong>See the artwork of masters</strong> at the Gallerie dell&#8217;Accademia, which has works by Titian, Giorgione, and Bellini.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>London</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Visit the British Museum</strong> to behold ancient Egyptian mummies, the Rosetta Stone, and other world treasures.</li>\n  <li><strong>Westminster Abbey</strong>: Founded in 960 AD, this church has been hosting royal weddings for the last nine centuries. It&#8217;s a stone&#8217;s throw from Big Ben and the River Thames.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hyde Park</strong>: a centrally located, manicured park affectionately known as London&#8217;s &#8220;green lung&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

You&#8217;ll be your own guide for this journey, which allows you to explore at your own pace; you can take optional side tours along the way for extra fees. Each option <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1NHxS08\">includes</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Round-trip airfare from New York</li>\n  <li>Airline taxes and fuel surcharges</li>\n  <li>Flight from Paris to Rome</li>\n  <li>3 nights of standard accommodations at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1SkgD7a\">Timhotel Berthier Paris 17</a> in Paris</li>\n  <li>3 nights of standard accommodations at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1ODJywP\">Holiday Inn Express Rome - San Giovanni</a> or <a href=\"http://www.hotelbestroma.com/EN/hotel.html\">Hotel Best Roma</a> in Rome</li>\n  <li>Daily breakfast</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Paris</h4>\n\n<p>For the first three nights you’ll be in Paris, one of the world’s most romantic cities. From your hotel, you&#8217;ll have easy access to both central Paris and the artsy enclave of Montmartre, home to the Moulin Rouge.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Sacre Coeur</strong> is a brilliant white Catholic church set high atop Montmartre—its tallest point reaches even higher than the Eiffel Tower. Climb up the steps for an expansive view of the city. </li>\n  <li><strong>Iconic architecture</strong>: The Eiffel Tower was dismissed by some critics as a &#8220;truly tragic street lamp&#8221; when it was built in the late 19th century. Millions of annual visitors from all over the world would beg to differ. It&#8217;s especially beautiful at night, when it twinkles with 20,000 lights.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat like a local</strong>: Stop at any of the sidewalk pastry vendors to try buttery croissants, handmade crepes, tarts, and more.</li>\n  <li><strong>Must-sees</strong>: <em>Mona Lisa</em> at the Louvre and Notre-Dame Cathedral</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional tours</strong>: the Louvre ($67/person), Seinorama ($74/person), or Versailles Apartments ($93 or $96/person)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Rome</h4>\n\n<p>For the next three nights, you’ll be stationed in Rome, amid a wellspring of history and culture. View the ruins of the grand columns and amphitheaters built by the likes of Emperors Hadrian and Trajan, and climb up to the Piazzale Garibaldi to see the entire city.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Colosseum</strong>: One of the Roman Empire&#8217;s great triumphs, this iconic amphitheater has stood since AD 80. Stand in the center and imagine tens of thousands of spectators filling the ancient stadium.</li>\n  <li><strong>Roman Forum</strong>: The heart of ancient Rome is this public square, full of statues and monuments, including the ruins of nine temples.</li>\n  <li><strong>St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica</strong>: Visit the enormous church in Vatican City, home to Michelangelo&#8217;s <em>Pietà</em> statue. While in Vatican City, you can walk over to the Sistine Chapel to see Michelangelo&#8217;s gorgeous frescoes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Toss a coin into Trevi Fountain</strong> to guarantee you&#8217;ll visit the city again; the fountain looks ethereal by moonlight.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional tours</strong>: ancient Rome ($64/person), Vatican Museums ($73/person), or food tour ($78 or $79/person)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

","highlightsHtml":"<p>Renovated 4-star DoubleTree hotel within walking distance of Central Park, United Nations headquarters, and Grand Central Terminal</p>","pitchHtml":"<h4>Hotel at a Glance: DoubleTree by Hilton Metropolitan</h4>\n\n<p>From the four-star DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Metropolitan, you can walk to a number of New York City landmarks—Times Square and Central Park are within a mile, and so are the fashionable boutiques and restaurants along Fifth Avenue. Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and the iconic Chrysler Building are less than a half mile away. It’s just as easy to explore more distant neighborhoods: the subway is around the corner, and Grand Central Terminal is a 10-minute walk away.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Art deco decor</strong>: This four-star hotel was built in 1961 by Morris Lapidus, an architect known for his art-deco designs. The building has been renovated since then, but it retains much of its original character, starting with the groovy green-and-red sign out front. </li>\n  <li><strong>Onsite dining</strong>: Off the main lobby, you can grab breakfast at the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/SNQ5gv\">Met Grill</a>; the space transforms into a chic lounge after hours.</li>\n  <li><strong>In-room luxury</strong>: <a href=\"http://gr.pn/RCpliE\">Guest rooms and suites</a> have been updated with new carpets, furniture, and bathroom fixtures. Each unit has a wall-mounted 37-inch flat-screen high-definition TV and luxurious bedding that includes down-filled duvets and plush-top mattresses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Midtown Manhattan: Iconic Sights and Shops Along Fifth Avenue</h4>\n\n<p>Midtown East refers to a 17-block stretch of central Manhattan between Fifth Avenue and the East River. The area is known for some of New York’s most famous landmarks, including Rockefeller Center—home to the iconic outdoor ice-skating rink, the <i>Today</i> show, and <i>Saturday Night Live</i>—and Grand Central Terminal, the world’s sixth-most-visited tourist attraction. Though in recent years Grand Central has filled with upscale restaurants and shops, it still serves as a major transportation hub with subway lines, Metro trains, and ziplines heading all over the city.</p>\n\n<p>A stroll down Fifth Avenue is a world-renowned shopping experience: the street is filled with luxury boutiques and flagship department stores, including the original Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman. For a little tranquility in the middle of the city, follow Fifth up to the southeast corner of Central Park. Just a few feet off the street is the Pond, which is spanned by a stone bridge. A little farther north, you’ll find the heart of Central Park Zoo.</p>\n\n<p>Another New York landmark towers over Madison Avenue, opposite Rockefeller Center and the 24-foot-tall <em>Atlas</em> statue out front. The late 19th-century neo-Gothic St. Patrick’s Cathedral occupies an entire city block and holds Mass more than 2,400 times every year.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The property has 13 swimming pools, each with slightly different features ranging from palm-tree-speckled islands to gradual entry designed to mimic a beach. You can spend your days lounging in the breezy beachfront cabanas or riding atop or beneath the waves with free kayaks, snorkeling equipment, and boogie boards. </p>\n\n<p>Mediterranean influences can be found throughout the sprawling property. Cobblestone walkways lead to three-story buildings with tile roofs and grand curved staircases. With the all-inclusive package, you’ll have your pick of two buffet restaurants, one VIP sports bar, and nine specialty <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1gB60ng\">restaurants</a> serving everything from authentic Dominican cuisine to Asian fusion.</p>\n\n<p>The hotel’s Los Mangos executive golf course has nine holes spread across lush greens jutting out over the sea. Basketball, tennis, and beach-volleyball courts are also sprinkled across the grounds. Come nightfall, you can party in the nightclub or opt for live entertainment at one of two theaters.</p>\n\n<h4>Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic: Waterfalls, Beaches, and Centuries-Old Historical Sites</h4>\n\n<p>Situated on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Plata is best known for its sun-kissed beaches. But the province has several breathtaking geographical features inland as well. Damajagua is a natural water park of sorts—it features 27 waterfalls flowing from limestone rock formations. Tour guides lead groups through the falls, and you can swim and occasionally slide down the natural water slides.</p>\n\n<p>You can get an aerial view of Puerto Plata and the Caribbean Sea on a teleférico, or cable car. One of them climbs 2,565 feet to the apex of Mount Isabel de Torres, which is crowned with blooming botanical gardens and a replica of Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s massive <em>Christ the Redeemer</em> statue. It&#8217;s also worth it to take a scenic drive to Parque Histórico La Isabela, where you&#8217;ll find the remains of a church as well as ruins of a colonial village where Columbus routinely woke his neighbors by blasting the <i>Santa Maria</i>&#8217;s foghorn.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>1. What kind of “local beers and spirits” are included in this all-inclusive VIP package?</strong> The local beer usually on draft is Presidente and the spirits available in this VIP package include popular premium or top shelf liquors.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How much for WiFi?</strong> WiFi is an additional fee and can be purchased in packages of hours or minutes from the front desk. For instance, a 25-hour package would cost $25.

What is the best way to travel to the hotel from the airport?</strong> The property is about 16 miles (26 km) from Gregorio Luperón International Airport (POP). Cab fare is about $55 per cab, each way.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Is there an additional occupancy fee, or do I have to purchase another Groupon?</strong> The Groupon covers two guests, and the valid room types have a maximum occupancy of three adults or two adults and two kids 11 or younger. Additional kids 3 or younger stay free, and each additional kid aged 4–11 is $20 per night. Additional guests 12 or older stay for $82 per person per night.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Will I be approached to attend a timeshare sales presentation?</strong> Groupon customers are never obligated to attend a sales presentation. If you are approached and decline a presentation, you will not lose the value of your Groupon or have to pay additional fees.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Which activities and amenities are included in the resort credits?</strong> No resort credits are included in this Groupon.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Are dinner reservations required for restaurants? Is there a dress code?</strong> Reservations are required for dinner at most non-buffet restaurants.

If you have any concerns about traveling to higher than your accustomed elevation, please consult your healthcare provider.</i></p>\n\n<h4>Days 1–3: Arrive in Quito</h4>\n\n<p>After a 4-hour flight from Miami, you&#8217;ll land in Ecuador&#8217;s capital city, Quito, which is one of the first cities to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. On an introductory city tour, you&#8217;ll see the impressive Presidential Palace, check out the city&#8217;s 16th-century colonial neighborhood, and explore notable churches such as the La Compañia Church or the Church of San Francisco. The latter is one of the city&#8217;s most historically significant monasteries.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Independence Plaza</strong> was Quito&#8217;s main square in the 16th century, acting as a central market as well as a bullfighting arena.</li>\n  <li><strong>Straddle two worlds</strong> at the Middle of the World monument, atop the equator; you can stand with one foot in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Day 4: Otavalo, Cotacachi, Peguche, and Papallacta</h4>\n\n<p>The group heads about 60 miles northeast of the city to the small town of Otavalo for shopping and scenic exploration.

The Amazon rainforest is called the &#8220;Lungs of the Earth,&#8221; and for good reason—the densely forested river basin covers 40% of South America and supplies the earth&#8217;s atmosphere with a substantial amount of oxygen.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Visit Ahuano</strong>, a small village where you&#8217;ll meet a Quechua family and learn about rural daily life and survival in the Amazon.</li>\n  <li><strong>Glide down the river</strong> on a traditional balsa log raft after an exhaustive hike through the rainforest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Days 7–9: Baños, Quito, and Departure</h4>\n\n<p>En route to Quito, you&#8217;ll stop in the town of Baños and take in its mountainous scenery with an overnight stay.

After landing in London and picking up your rental car, you&#8217;re free to spend the next 3 nights at your chosen English B&amp;B, taking side trips as you see fit. Next, you&#8217;ll return to London to board a flight to Dublin, where you&#8217;ll have another 3 nights to explore the Emerald Isle at your leisure. Each option <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1lyQKlF\">includes</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Round-trip airfare from New York (JFK), Boston (BOS), or Los Angeles (LAX)</li>\n  <li>One-way flight from London to Dublin (additional bag fees may apply)</li>\n  <li>Car rental in both countries for the duration of stay</li>\n  <li>3 nights of accommodations in a bed and breakfast of your choice in England; <a href=\"http://www.circlehotels.co.uk/\">click here</a> to find a bed and breakfast</li>\n  <li>3 nights of accommodations in a bed and breakfast of your choice in Ireland; <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1HuXGcm\">click here</a> to find a bed and breakfast.</li>\n  <li>Click <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1lyQKlF\">here</a> to see specific date availability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>England</h4>\n\n<p>Your trip begins with a flight to London, the UK&#8217;s 2,000-year-old capital. While you’re here, say hello to Big Ben and the River Thames, which bisects the city as it flows across England. Use the included rental car to venture out to your chosen B&amp;B in the English countryside. Here are a few of the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1MQD4wB\">accommodations</a> you can choose from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Hobbit Hole</strong>: About 90 minutes from London, on Herne Bay in Kent, this small bungalow has an enviable 5-star average on TripAdvisor. Amenities include free WiFi and a charming garden.</li>\n  <li><strong>Barnard House</strong>: This three-room B&amp;B on a quiet residential street is a 10-minute walk from the beach. It&#8217;s in the coastal town of Great Yarmouth, less than a 3-hour drive from London.</li>\n  <li><strong>Racecourse Farm</strong>: A traditional English cottage built some 250 years ago, this inn places you in the rural heart of the English Midlands. The surroundings are mainly pasture, with a village pub a few minutes&#8217; walk away.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Ireland</h4>\n\n<p>After 3 nights in England, you&#8217;ll catch a plane to Dublin, the lively and historic capital city of Ireland. In the countryside, it&#8217;ll take you no time to see why green is the obligatory color of St. Patrick’s Day celebrations the world over. The country—about the size of Indiana—takes the notions of “lush” and “green” to a whole new level. Experience it for yourself during 3 nights at an Irish B&amp;B. We&#8217;ve listed some of the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1HuXGcm\">possibilities</a> below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Annandale House</strong> is conveniently situated between the airport and Dublin&#8217;s city center. The innkeepers are happy to give directions to wherever you might be headed, and there&#8217;s a pub just around the corner where you can sip a hearty pint of Guinness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rossroe Lodge</strong>: Getting to this B&amp;B on Ireland&#8217;s west coast means driving across the country, but that&#8217;s not so hard—it takes less than 4 hours from coast to coast. Once you&#8217;re here, you&#8217;ll enjoy views of Cashel Bay and surrounding mountains. We recommend stopping by Galway on the way in or out.</li>\n  <li><strong>Killarney House</strong>: This luxury B&amp;B is within walking distance of Blarney Castle, home of the famous Blarney Stone. The city of Cork is just a 15-minute drive away.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

This vacation includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Round-trip airfare from Fort Lauderdale (FLL), New York City, Boston (BOS), Baltimore (BWI), Los Angeles (LAX), Chicago, or Atlanta (ATL)</li>\n  <li>5 nights of all-inclusive accommodations in a comfort room at <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1legsvb\">Catalonia Gran Dominicus</a></li>\n  <li>All meals and snacks, including four à la carte restaurants and a 24-hour snack bar</li>\n  <li>All beverages, including alcohol</li>\n  <li>Kids&#8217; club and daily activities program</li>\n  <li>Daily activities</li>\n  <li>Nightly entertainment</li>\n  <li>Disco bar and casino</li>\n  <li>Nonmotorized watersports (snorkeling equipment, canoes, kayaks, and catamarans)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Hotel at a Glance: Catalonia Gran Dominicus</h4>\n\n<p>A row of palm trees and a stretch of white sand are all that separate you from the ocean at this Dominican resort. When you&#8217;re not sipping cocktails beneath thatched umbrellas, you can canoe along the shore or take a dip in the large outdoor pool. After sunset, the party gets started at the resort&#8217;s discotheque, which plays upbeat dance tunes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Explore the ocean</strong>: Borrow snorkeling gear or ride a catamaran.</li>\n  <li><strong>Diverse dining options</strong> range from gourmet Italian cuisine to juicy steaks at one of several restaurants.</li>\n  <li><strong>Alegria Spa</strong>: Indulge in a relaxing massage or skin-soothing facial.</li>\n  <li><strong>Recent accolade</strong>: TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Bayahibe, Dominican Republic: Renowned Scuba Diving with White-Sand Beaches</h4>\n\n<p>Bayahibe is a former fishing village situated on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic. It remained relatively untouched by tourism until the late 1990s, when it became known for its white-sand beaches and scuba-diving sites. For diving and snorkeling, it&#8217;s worth taking a trip to Saona Island, an uninhabited nature reserve located just off the mainland. Tour operators on catamarans and motorboats will take you to sandbars and shipwrecks inhabited by brightly colored fish.</p>\n\n<p>The cobblestone streets of Altos de Chavón are lined with artists&#8217; studios, galleries, and quaint cafés. The village is also home to a 5,000-seat amphitheater, which has featured headlining shows from superstars ranging from Frank Sinatra to Shakira.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. From what airport does the deal depart?  How much does it cost to fly from a city that isn&#8217;t included in the deal options?</strong> Deal options with 3-letter airport codes depart from that specific airport. Deal options with full city names depart from an airport that is assigned at time of redemption with the tour operator. Departures from airports that are not included in the deal options may be available (and may cost more). Call Travel by Jen at 1-800-603-3178 for pricing from any airport that isn&#8217;t listed on the Groupon Getaways deal page.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How do I find out if the dates I want to travel are available?</strong> To check the availability of specific dates within the option you would like to purchase, please call us at 1-800-603-3178.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Do I need to buy a Groupon for my child?</strong> Discounted rates may be available for children 12 and under. Please contact us at 1-800-603-3178 for child pricing.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Can the person I&#8217;m traveling with fly from a different city?</strong> As long as you are sharing a hotel room, the two people traveling together may fly from any city.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. What happens if I buy the Groupon and my travel dates are not available?</strong> We will do everything we can to accommodate the dates you wish to travel. In the event that we are unable to do so, the &#8220;Groupon Promise&#8221; allows you to refund your voucher.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Is this deal priced per person? What does &#8220;per person, based on double occupancy&#8221; mean?</strong> Prices are per person based on a minimum of 2 passengers booking together and sharing a hotel room. Each traveler must purchase a Groupon Voucher. Solo travelers must pay a single room supplement fee directly to Travel by Jen, as no room matching program is available.

On clear days, you can even catch a glimpse of the volcano from the outdoor swimming pool. <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1vcLNvs\">Newly constructed rooms</a> feature private bathrooms and free WiFi, plus microwaves, refrigerators, and coffeemakers. The hotel, which was named 1 of Costa Rica&#8217;s Top 25 Bargain Hotels by TripAdvisor, borders a small nature reserve filled with lush tropical foliage and native wildlife, including parrots and howler monkeys. Guests may be accommodated in a hotel of similar quality if Hotel Lavas del Arenal is unavailable.</p>\n\n<h4>La Fortuna, Costa Rica: Arenal Volcano, Soothing Hot Springs, and Exotic Birds</h4>\n\n<p>Until very recently, Arenal was Costa Rica’s most active volcano. It’s dormant now, but the surrounding region is no less stunning, with hiking trails, fertile rainforests, whitewater rapids for kayaking, and a lake that&#8217;s perfect for watersports. And many tourists still come to see the volcano, which punctuates the varied topography of Arenal Volcano National Park.</p>\n\n<p>The park contains a diverse ecosystem near the center of Costa Rica. Birders come here from all over the world to glimpse some 850 species of feathery friends, including the rare and striking Resplendent Quetzal. The rich landscape is marked by waterfalls and a few rivers ideal for whitewater rafting, most notably Rio Toro. The park is also a prime spot to take a scenic hike through dense cloud forest by way of hanging bridges.</p>\n\n<p>A more rugged trek awaits at Sendero Coladas, or Lava Flow Trail, which leads to a field of jagged volcanic rock that formed after the eruption decades ago. Due to its geothermal activity, the park is also home to a number of natural hot springs. These therapeutic springs are a nice spot to unwind after a hike or a sing-off with a howler monkey.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

Fill the days by napping in a cabana, riding a jet ski, or sipping tropical drinks at the bar.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Make a reservation</strong> at Kitchen 305, which offers an upscale dining experience with hearty steak and fresh seafood.</li>\n  <li><strong>Treat yourself</strong> to a hot-stone massage or custom facial at the Aveda Seven Seas Spa and Salon.</li>\n  <li><strong>In-room amenities</strong>: microwave, refrigerator, WiFi, TV, and jetted tub; some suites overlook the ocean</li>\n  <li><strong>Shop till you drop</strong> at nearby Aventura Mall; stores include Burberry, Tiffany, and Louis Vuitton.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Sunny Isles Beach, Florida: Tropical Oasis North of Miami</h4>\n\n<p>Sunny Isles Beach experienced a renaissance in the late 1990s, when the main thoroughfare, Collins Avenue, transformed from a rambling row of motels into a luxury strip of oceanfront high-rises and resorts. The city lies halfway between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, with 2.5 miles of uninterrupted shoreline running along its length. It&#8217;s home to the half-mile-long Newport Fishing Pier, the only remaining public pier in Miami-Dade County.</p>\n\n<p>Starting daily at 9:15 a.m., lifeguards take to their stands along the city&#8217;s beaches. Samson Oceanfront Park is a family-friendly escape, and Jet Ski King rents jet skis, banana boats, and waverunners for adventures on the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

All the quaint charm of this original Craftsman house remains, but its interiors are fully modernized and well preserved, with uniquely decorated rooms full of homey touches and antique accents.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Wine tastings</strong>: This Getaway includes complimentary tastings for two at T Vine and Tank Garage.</li>\n  <li><strong>Where you&#8217;ll stay</strong>: Individually decorated <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1o981Cm\">guest rooms</a> feature private bathrooms, free WiFi, and complimentary afternoon wine service.</li>\n  <li><strong>Breakfast is served</strong>: A gourmet breakfast is served each morning.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mountains views</strong>: You can see Mount Saint Helena and the Palisades from the multilevel redwood deck behind the inn.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sip coffee</strong> in the glass-roofed dining room or outdoors at one of the garden tables.</li>\n  <li><strong>Head to the shops</strong> and restaurants in nearby downtown Calistoga.</li>\n  <li><strong>Recent Accolade</strong>: A TripAdvisor Hall of Fame award, given to properties with Certificates of Excellences five years in a row.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Calistoga, California: Down-to-Earth Hamlet in Northern Napa Valley</h4>\n\n<p>The story goes like this: 19th-century developer Samuel Brannan wanted to create a West Coast version of Saratoga Springs (renowned at the time for its mineral spas), but he had been drinking when he made the announcement and so the name came out garbled as the &#8220;Calistoga of Sarifornia.&#8221; This origin myth sounds a little fishy, but nevertheless, Brannan&#8217;s vision of creating a relaxing and therapeutic Napa Valley getaway was eventually realized. Thanks to the area&#8217;s natural hot springs, a slew of spas sprang up, offering restorative mineral soaks and mud baths. You can still find many such businesses peppered among the restaurants, boutiques, and art galleries lining Calistoga&#8217;s quaint, quiet main street, which is set against a backdrop of rolling hills.</p>\n\n<p>Those hills are home to some of Napa Valley&#8217;s more than 400 wineries, many of which lie within a short drive of downtown Calistoga. The curious wine lover can choose from a wide array of vineyard experiences, ranging from tours to tastings at wineries modeled on English castles and Tuscan villas. One word of warning: many of these places require reservations, so be sure to book in advance.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Everywhere you look, you’ll notice how the resort draws inspiration from its tropical surroundings and pays tribute to Mayan, creole, and African traditions. Carved masks line the walls and fresh hibiscus blossoms dot the footpaths. This exotic setting provides the backdrop for this stylish, chic resort, which won a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence in 2014.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Don&#8217;t go chasing waterfalls</strong> unless you follow one into the waterfall-fed pool, open 24 hours.</li>\n  <li><strong>17 types of rum</strong> infused on site for Maruba&#8217;s night spot, Glow Bar</li>\n  <li><strong>Watery excursions</strong>: The spa offers diving, fishing, and snorkeling tours.</li>\n  <li><strong>Treat your skin</strong> to a seaweed body wrap or Mood Mud treatment, which uses Belizean jungle muds to moisturize, exfoliate, or reduce signs of aging.</li>\n  <li><strong>Guided hikes</strong> highlight the medicinal uses of the jungle&#8217;s flora and fauna. Jungle excursions include cave tubing, ziplining, and horseback riding.</li>\n  <li><strong>Nouveau jungle cuisine</strong>: Ingredients sourced from the spa&#8217;s backyard are used in spanish mackerel and beef carbonade. Dishes are served on an open-air patio or in a jungle treehouse.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Maskall, Belize: Rural Village near Ancient Ruins</h4>\n\n<p>Though it&#8217;s tucked away in a rural corner of the Belize rainforest, Maskall lies only a few miles from one of the country&#8217;s most famous attractions: Altun Ha. The archaeological site once served as a major Mayan trading center and may also have been a religious center. Today, its stepped pyramids appear on Belizean banknotes as well as the label of Belikin beer, a local brew.</p>\n\n<p>There are a handful of less-trafficked ruins within easy reach of the village as well. Cuello, one of the oldest known Mayan ruins, and Lamanai, which was once a flourishing Mayan city set along a wide lagoon, are just a half-hour drive away. It’s also worth it to visit the Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary, which harbors Central American river turtles—“hickatees” to locals—Mexican black howler monkeys, and a large population of jabiru storks on more than 16,000 acres of secluded lagoons, logwood swamps, and forests.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. What is the best way to travel to the hotel from the airport?</strong> Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport (BZE) is 30 miles from the property. A one-way transfer for two to BZE included with the Groupon.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Is there an additional occupancy fee, or do I have to purchase another Groupon?</strong> The Groupon covers two guests. One kid 11 or younger is allowed above standard occupancy and stays for free.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Will I be approached to attend a timeshare sales presentation?</strong> Groupon customers are never obligated to attend a sales presentation. If you are approached and decline a presentation, you will not lose the value of your Groupon or have to pay additional fees.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Which activities and amenities are included in the resort credits?</strong> Resort credits are not included with the Groupon.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

The pool (one of four) belongs to Mystic Dunes Resort &amp; Golf Club, a family-friendly retreat situated a short shuttle ride from Walt Disney World® Theme Parks, Universal Orlando Resort, and SeaWorld.</p>\n\n<p>Furnished with plush couches, glass tables, and king- or queen-size beds, the resort&#8217;s one- and two-bedroom villas feature fully appointed kitchens and soaker tubs. The property&#8217;s quartet of pools includes Dunes Lagoon, which boasts a two-story water slide and private cabanas.</p>\n\n<p>With this Getaway, you&#8217;ll get a City Perks Pass, as well as passes to Wild Florida wildlife park, home to a number of native Florida species as well as zebras, water buffalo, and emu. While you&#8217;re here, you can feed and even touch some of the animals.</p>\n\n<p>Mystic Dunes Golf Club&#8217;s championship course was designed by PGA Tour alum and television analyst Gary Koch, who incorporated 80-foot elevation changes, rolling dunes, and scenic vistas. The front nine recalls the Carolinian Lowcountry—all wetland, marsh, and cypress forest—and the back nine transports players across the pond with British-style links punctuated by pot bunkers and lush fairways.</p>\n\n<h4>Kissimmee, Florida: Easy Access to World-Famous Theme Parks and Major Orlando Attractions</h4>\n\n<p>Located on the banks of Lake Tohopekaliga, Kissimmee sits about 22 miles from downtown Orlando and just 16 miles from the Walt Disney World® Theme Parks. The world’s most-visited entertainment resort spans roughly 30,000 acres, encompassing four theme parks, two water parks, five golf courses, and the Downtown Disney® Area. There’s no shortage of things to do here: begin your day at Magic Kingdom® Park by boarding Space Mountain® Attraction, a rocket-shaped three-seater that climbs to 180 feet before entering a deep black tunnel and racing past stars, satellites, and constellations. After that, ride past the ghastly goofballs inside The Haunted Mansion. For dinner, head over to Epcot® to sample cuisine from Morocco, Mexico, France, Italy, and several other countries at the World Showcase. As one of the most popular family destinations in the world, sunny Orlando is home to other theme parks including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando.</p>\n\n<p>Those hoping to shake up the typical theme-park-dominated itinerary can head into downtown Orlando&#8217;s vibrant arts district. The neighborhood boasts venues such as the CityArts Factory, a multifaceted patchwork of gallery spaces, and <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/sak-comedy-lab\">SAK Comedy Lab</a>, which holds improv shows five nights a week.</p>\n\n<p>About a 10-minute drive north, you’ll find several cultural institutions surrounding Loch Haven Park, including the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/orlando-museum-of-art\">Orlando Museum of Art</a>; the collection features pieces by Georgia O’Keeffe, Robert Rauschenberg, Ansel Adams, and Andy Warhol. The park is also home to the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/orlando-shakespeare-theater\">Orlando Shakespeare Theater</a> and the Orlando Science Center, where you can take a rover across a simulation of Mars or race model cars down a 70-foot pinewood-derby track.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

People from all over the world come here to enjoy the white-sand beaches, shop the high-end boutiques, and party at the legendary see-and-be-seen nightclubs the city is known for. The red-hot center of this sexy, international social scene is South Beach, a 20-block stretch filled with upscale lounges, rooftop bars, and ultrahip hangouts behind velvet ropes. Lummus Park beach is packed by mid-morning, and the clubs on Ocean Drive and Washington Avenue—many of which stay open until 5 a.m.—vie for the limelight with VIP service, celebrity DJs, and dressed-to-the-nines crowds.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the fast-paced luxury of South Beach lies Miami Beach’s softer side. A leisurely stroll through the Art Deco District reveals hundreds of beautiful, candy-colored buildings, including Versace Mansion—a 1930 manor modeled after a palace in the Dominican Republic that belonged to Christopher Columbus’s family. The centerpiece of the city’s arts scene, the Bass Museum of Art displays works from Peter Paul Rubens and Sandro Botticelli, and modern-design objects and propaganda arts fill three stories at the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/miami-beach-fl/wolfsonian-museum-1\">Wolfsonian-FIU</a> museum. There’s also a handful of vibrant ethnic enclaves to explore here, and Little Havana is among the most notable. The neighborhood is lined with family-owned restaurants and Caribbean-style marketplaces, making it a great place to discover some of the country’s most delicious Cuban food, from sugary guarapo juice to pastelitos, or Cuban pastries.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

Lauderdale to the north. Though this part of south Florida is less crowded than those bustling cities, you&#8217;re still near plenty of shopping, dining, and nightlife options, and a picture-perfect beach is just a block away.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Chic guest rooms</strong> feature modern furnishings and balconies or terraces overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway, Atlantic Ocean, or city skyline. Each <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1MXLPk7\">suite</a> comes with a dining room, living room, kitchen, and washer/dryer.</li>\n  <li><strong>Food and drink</strong>: Dining options include a bistro serving fresh contemporary fare made with local ingredients, as well as a pool grill and a marketplace for grabbing snacks on the go. </li>\n  <li><strong>Distance from the beach</strong>: one block</li>\n  <li><strong>Take a dip</strong> in the infinity-edge pool.</li>\n  <li><strong>Beach club access</strong>: Free transportation via electric cart will take you to Hyde Beach Kitchen + Cocktails, which is set right on the sand and offers complimentary chairs, towels, and umbrellas. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Hollywood, Florida: Quiet Coastal Town with Beachfront Boardwalk</h4>\n\n<p>Hollywood is situated just a few miles south of Fort Lauderdale and about a half hour drive north of Miami, but it&#8217;s quite a bit more relaxed than both. The town’s beach boardwalk—named one of the country’s best by <em>Travel + Leisure</em>—stretches alongside the Atlantic Ocean for 2.5 miles, attracting joggers, bicyclists, and shoppers. To get to the boardwalk from downtown, hop aboard the old-timey trolley that makes runs to the beach Wednesday–Sunday. Other Hollywood attractions include the Anne Kolb Nature Center, a 1,500-acre wetland where you can kayak through tidal channels or take walking trails through red-mangrove forests.</p>\n\n<p>The tempo picks up in neighboring Fort Lauderdale, a city famous for its beaches and boats. During the day, water taxis cruise the Intracoastal Waterway, offering up-close views of waterfront mansions and anchored yachts. At night, hit up the upscale bars and restaurants on Las Olas Boulevard.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

You might see leopards slinking around in the late afternoon.</li>\n  <li><strong>The centerpiece</strong> of the park is Mount Meru, an active stratovolcano that rises nearly 15,000 feet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Day 5: Tarangire National Park, Tanzania</h4>\n\n<p>This park is home to more than 500 bird species and large herds of elephants and giraffes. Because it&#8217;s relatively small, it has a denser concentration of wildlife, so you have a greater chance of seeing animals in action.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Rare animals</strong>: Gerenuk, lesser kudu, greater kudu, oryx, and even eland may be more easily found here than in other parks thanks to its size and altitude.</li>\n  <li><strong>Elephants on parade</strong>: Herds in the park can be as many as 300 strong, making for an impressive photo op.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Day 6: Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania</h4>\n\n<p>Ernest Hemingway called this park the loveliest he had seen in Africa. It&#8217;s centered on Lake Manyara, whose dramatic stone rift reaches more than 1,900 feet in height.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Action-packed day</strong>: Day 6 includes three game drives and a picnic lunch.</li>\n  <li><strong>Animals to look out for</strong>: elephants, hippos, zebras, giraffes, and baboons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Days 7 and 8: Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area, Tanzania</h4>\n\n<p>Often called the Eighth Wonder of the World, Ngorongoro Conservation Area encompasses a soaring plateau of volcanic highlands and craters. It was originally designed to accommodate indigenous Masai communities and visitors, so you might see villagers grazing their cattle and donkeys.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Big Five</strong>: View buffalo, elephants, leopards, lions, and rhinos on a full-day game drive with lunch.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ngorongoro Crater</strong> is the world’s largest unbroken volcanic caldera. It&#8217;s densely packed with some 250,000 wild animals, including the prehistoric black rhinoceros. On day 7, you&#8217;ll head to the floor of the caldera on a full-day crater tour.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Days 9 and 10: Depart Tanzania or Extend Your Trip</h4>\n\n<p>Depending on the option you choose, on day 9 you&#8217;ll either do a game drive in the morning and lunch in Arusha before you begin your journey home, or you&#8217;ll take an extended adventure to Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>If you stay</strong>: You&#8217;ll spend day 9 hiking the mountain and depart on day 10, arriving home on day 11. You&#8217;ll get an extra day&#8217;s worth of meals, too.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mount Kilimanjaro</strong>: You will have seen the peak rising in the distance throughout your trip; this is your chance to see the behemoth up close and explore its rocky gorges.</li>\n  <li><strong>Additional extensions</strong>: You may also extend your trip to travel to the Serengeti or Zanzibar. Contact Odyssey Safaris for details.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1.

The 4-star Solara Resort &amp; Spa makes for an excellent base camp to experience outdoor fun in western Alberta, just 20 minutes outside of Banff. At day&#8217;s end, you&#8217;ll warm up in a luxurious <a href=\"http://www.solararesort.ca/accommodations\">suite</a> equipped with a full kitchen, fireplace, washer and dryer, and WiFi.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Hit the slopes</strong> at nearby Nakiska Ski Resort or Mt.

A modest coal-mining village until 1979, the town attracted international attention when it was chosen as the site of the Nordic ski events for the 1988 Winter Olympics. Just a few miles outside of town, <a href=\"http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/banff/index.aspx\">Banff National Park</a> encompasses more than 4,100 square miles (6,600 square km) of dramatic mountains, glacier lakes, and limestone canyons.</p>\n\n<p>Downtown Canmore centers on Main Street, a three-block shopping boulevard lined with brewpubs, art galleries, and boutiques, with an eclectic live-music scene entertaining crowds late into the night. Though Canmore has come a long way since its coal-mining days—more than 30 eateries in town now serve international cuisine—the town keeps its industrial heritage alive through mining museums, commemorative statues, and suspended animation.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

According to local legend, some of these treasures are still buried at the shore, alongside Spanish silver daggers. “Port A,” as the locals call it, has since developed into a popular resort town, thanks to its wide, sandy beaches and sportfishing. The condos at Pirates Bay give guests access to both. </p>\n\n<p>You can choose from four properties, all of which are situated near beaches, bars, and restaurants. Both the <a href=\"http://www.fredericksburg-lodging.com/All-seasons-vacation-rentals/Buccaneer-Retreat2/\">Buccaneer Retreat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fredericksburg-lodging.com/All-seasons-vacation-rentals/Main-sail-cottage2/\">Main Sail Cottage</a> have three bedrooms with two bunk beds, three bathrooms, and full kitchens, and are close to plenty of surfing, swimming, snorkeling, and jet-skiing opportunities. The Ahoy Matey Island Retreat cottages are decorated with limited-edition artwork and Tiffany lamps, and the Admirals Quarter Cottages have zero-entry pools. </p>\n\n<h4>Port Aransas, Texas: Sunny Beach Town with Excellent Fishing</h4>\n\n<p>Port Aransas is located at the northern end of Mustang Island, a narrow landmass that stretches for 18 miles off the Gulf Coast in Texas. The area’s frequent sunshine and uncrowded public beaches have made it increasingly popular with vacationing families as well as spring-breaking college students. Out-of-towners often frequent the beachside clubs and bars, or rent kayaks and surfboards to paddle through the waves.</p>\n\n<p>Fishing is a major pastime in Port Aransas. More than 20 competitive tournaments are held here, thanks to the tuna, kingfish, and marlin you can catch out on the water (keep your eyes peeled for dolphins while you’re out there). When you return to land, bring your catch to one of the island eateries and many of them will grill it for you on the spot.</p>\n\n<p>There are 1,200 acres of tidal flats and undeveloped shore land to explore at the Port Aransas Nature Preserve, which features a boardwalk and three miles of hiking and biking trails. Head up to one of the lookout towers to watch for rare and endangered birds such as the Piping Plover, a stout shorebird with an appetite for crustaceans.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The town of Lahaina, along Maui’s western coast, served as Hawaii’s royal capital before 1845. Throughout the mid-19th century, it was known as a whaling town—Herman Melville sailed from Lahaina during this time and gathered inspiration for <em>Moby-Dick</em>. The humpback whales that were once hunted are now protected by the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary, and their population has flourished. The seas around Lahaina boast some of the world’s best whale watching from December to May, when female humpbacks give birth in the warm Pacific waters.</p>\n\n<p>Arguably, Maui&#8217;s biggest attraction is Haleakala, the world&#8217;s largest dormant volcano, which technically encompasses 75% of the island. A paved road leads up to Haleakala&#8217;s summit, where you can stretch your legs and walk around the rim of the lunar-like volcanic crater. The towering peak is a playground for bicyclists, who coast down the slopes all the way to the beach town of Paia.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere on the island, it’s a rite of passage to drive the Road to Hana, a 68-mile route that zigzags along the scenic northeastern coast with more than 600 hairpin curves. There are several points of interest along the way, including botanical gardens, tiny villages, and waterfall pools you can swim in.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

By the time guests wake up, the staff has already prepared and laid out a spread of pancakes, hash browns, and oatmeal alongside cold items including cereal, fruit, and pastries.

It hosts the annual U.S. Open of Surfing, the Beach Boys name-dropped it in their song ”Surfin’ Safari,” and eager surfers come from miles away to paddle into the Pacific. The average temperature in Huntington Beach is a near-perfect 67 degrees all year, and sun is almost always shining. In addition to the beach, you can explore the iconic Huntington Beach Pier. Rent a fishing pole to angle for halibut and sea bass (you don’t need a license), or buy a T-shirt at the pier’s souvenir stand. Stroll around downtown Huntington Beach to take in the laid-back surf-town atmosphere and pick up a pair of flip-flops—they’re standard footwear here.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?

The world’s most-visited entertainment resort spans roughly 30,000 acres, encompassing four theme parks, two water parks, five golf courses, and the Downtown Disney® Area. There’s no shortage of things to do here: begin your day at Magic Kingdom® Park by boarding Space Mountain® Attraction, a rocket-shaped three-seater that climbs to 180 feet before entering a deep black tunnel and racing past stars, satellites, and constellations. After that, ride past the ghastly goofballs inside The Haunted Mansion. For dinner, head over to Epcot® to sample cuisine from Morocco, Mexico, France, Italy, and several other countries at the World Showcase. As one of the most popular family destinations in the world, sunny Orlando is home to other theme parks including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando.</p>\n\n<p>Those hoping to shake up the typical theme-park-dominated itinerary can head into downtown Orlando&#8217;s vibrant arts district. The neighborhood boasts venues such as the CityArts Factory, a multifaceted patchwork of gallery spaces, and <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/sak-comedy-lab\">SAK Comedy Lab</a>, which holds improv shows five nights a week.</p>\n\n<p>About a 10-minute drive north, you’ll find several cultural institutions surrounding Loch Haven Park, including the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/orlando-museum-of-art\">Orlando Museum of Art</a>; the collection features pieces by Georgia O’Keeffe, Robert Rauschenberg, Ansel Adams, and Andy Warhol. The park is also home to the <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/orlando-shakespeare-theater\">Orlando Shakespeare Theater</a> and the Orlando Science Center, where you can take a rover across a simulation of Mars or race model cars down a 70-foot pinewood-derby track.</p>\n\n<p><em>Love to travel?
